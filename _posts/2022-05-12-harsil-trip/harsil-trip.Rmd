2022 was the year of fresh starts, for most of us, who have been confined to their homes for the past two years since the covid-19 pandemic.
We (Manjari and myself) had a mildly productive year in 2021, and managed to submit our respective Doctoral theses for review.
As we wrapped up the rest of our academic obligations we had window of opportunity to visit Harsil.
We came to know of Harsil from Ankita Sinha, who studied riverine birds and their ecology along several Himalayan rivers and had intimate knowledge of Harsil.
Over the years, she would tell us about the rare birds she had encountered in that area.
Unfortunately, we could not find time from our own field obligations to visit this beautiful valley.
A long weekend holiday of four days was round the corner, and we wanted to make good use of it.
We packed our bags and called Ankita to let her know of our plans.
She graciously communicated with her local contacts and arranged for hotel rooms at discounted prices for us.
Next we called up local cab owners and arranged for a pickup and drop deal.
Mr. Asif from Turner road, agreed to drop us at Harsil for INR5500, which was quite deal since most of the other drivers were quoting figures close to twice the amount.
We started our journey from Dehradun at 6am Thursday, April 14.
The distance to Hrsil is about 250 kilometers but most of the road is through hilly regions and hence it translates to about the same as travelling 500kms on the plains.
Thankfully we had an early start.
Mr. Asif was a long time resident of Dehradun and on the way to Harsil he narrated several stories of his exploits and kept us entertained.
Like typical Doonites, the three of us kept on blaming everyone else for ruining and polluting the beautiful valley.
Our conversations started from the lost green cover of Dehradun to the unsightly expansion of the city that all of us have grown to love.

### Birds

Everyone has different priorities for choosing their vacation spots.
We have two primary criteria, the location should not be overtly touristy, and it should have good spots for birding.
Harsil falls on the circuit of the char-dham yatra, and during that time the place is flooded with pilgrims from all over the country trying to score brownie points with their respective saviours.
We planned our trip before the commencement of the Char-dham yatra and hence were saved from the mad-rush.
Harsil is a great place to some rare himalayan birds and we have been told so by several of our colleagues at Wildlife Institute of India.
Hence Harsil was a no-brainer.

We had seen beautiful himalayan villages before during our trekking trips around uttarakhand but nothing prepared us for the beauty of Harsil.
We spent every waking moment awestruck by the majesty of vast snow-clad himalayan peaks.
It was humbling to grasp that the life-giving Ganga has its origins nearby and

### The Views

Birds aside, Harsil is a beautiful place.
The village of Harsil falls on a ancient trade route that connects India with Tibet.
The ancient villages of Harsil, Mukba, and Jhala still have old routes that connect it to surrounding countries.
First day of the trip we set out to visit the village of Mukhba/Mukba.
The Hindu diety Ganga who is the embodiment of the Holy river Ganga that nurtures major parts of India has her primary temple at Gangotri.
During the Char-dham yatra pilgrims come to visit Ganga and seek her blessings.
For most parts of the year, the statue of the diety stays in Gangotri, and it is shifted to Mukhba during the harsh winter months.
When we were visiting Harsil, the diety was presiding at Mukhba and we had the golden opportunity to get her blessings.
