  abstract = {The halal meat industry is today a reality in many regions of the world, including the European Union. The main religious laws in the area of halal meat production were legislated in ancient times and may be unchangeable due to their sanctity perceived by faithful Muslims, while the modern technology used in the meat industry is constantly evolving and being updated. The objective of this study is to highlight the points of controversy between the principles of halal and the technological means currently used in the meat industry. Modern slaughter practices, including animal fasting prior to slaughter, animal body position, the location of the incision during slaughter, stunning and mechanical slaughter, are reviewed. The purpose of preslaughter feed availability according to halal criteria could be to ensure greater welfare for animals, though feed withdrawal is necessary today. Although there is no clear unified opinion among the Islamic sects, reversible stunning of animals is generally accepted. A neck cut at a higher position than the conventional low cut in cattle may reduce the compromise in welfare (the onset of unconsciousness), minimise false aneurysm and be compatible with halal criteria. This study may contribute towards consideration being given to technology that is not in conflict with the religious legislation, while at the same time meeting the requirements of the modern meat industry.},

  abstract = {Animal conservation practices include the grouping of captive related and unrelated individuals to form a social structure which is characteristic of that species in the wild. In response to the rapid decline of wild African lion (Panthera leo) populations, an array of conservational strategies have been adopted. Ex situ reintroduction of the African lion requires the construction of socially cohesive pride structures prior to wild release. This pilot study adopted a social network theory approach to quantitatively assess a captive pride's social structure and the relationships between individuals within them. Group composition (who is present in a group) and social interaction data (social licking, greeting, play) was observed and recorded to assess social cohesion within a released semi-wild pride. UCINET and SOCPROG software was utilised to represent and analyse these social networks. Results indicate that the pride is socially cohesive, does not exhibit random associations, and the role of socially influential keystone individuals is important for maintaining social bondedness within a lion pride. These results are potentially informative for the structure of lion prides, in captivity and in the wild, and could have implications for captive and wild-founder reintroductions.},

  abstract = {Decision-making processes in medicine rely increasingly on modelling and simulation techniques; they are especially useful when combining evidence from multiple sources. Markov models are frequently used to synthesize the available evidence for such simulation studies, by describing disease and treatment progress, as well as associated factors such as the treatment's effects on a patient's life and the costs to society. When the same decision problem is investigated by multiple stakeholders, differing modelling assumptions are often applied, making synthesis and interpretation of the results difficult. This paper proposes a standardized approach towards the creation of Markov models. It introduces the notion of 'general Markov models', providing a common definition of the Markov models that underlie many similar decision problems, and develops a language for their specification. We demonstrate the application of this language by developing a general Markov model for adverse event analysis in radiotherapy and argue that the proposed method can automate the creation of Markov models from existing data. The approach has the potential to support the radiotherapy community in conducting systematic analyses involving predictive modelling of existing and upcoming radiotherapy data. We expect it to facilitate the application of modelling techniques in medical decision problems beyond the field of radiotherapy, and to improve the comparability of their results.},

Instead, behaviourists must rely on rank-transformation tests, which lose potentially valuable information present in the data. Recently, however, biologists in other disciplines have resolved similar statistical difficulties by using resampling methods. Results from Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric ANOVA and randomization tests were compared for two behavioural data sets. It was found that randomization tests were more powerful than Kruskal-Wallis, and could thus detect smaller effect sizes present in the data. In addition, the variance was calculated around theP-value at eight levels of replication ranging from 500 to 10 000, to determine the optimal number of replications for the randomization test. The variance around theP-value decreased as the number of replications increased. TheP-value stabilized at 5000 replications, and thus it is recommended that at least 5000 replications be used for randomization tests on behavioural data.},

  abstract = {Evidence suggests that patients suffer the painful symptoms of dentine hypersensitivity when dentine is exposed and the dentinal tubule system is opened to the oral cavity to allow stimuli to trigger a neural response in the pulp via a hydrodynamic mechanism. The processes needed to localise lesions of dentine hypersensitivity include loss of enamel and/or gingival recession. Whilst tooth brushing with or without toothpaste appears to cause minimal wear to enamel (in the absence of acids), circumstantial evidence implicates tooth brushing with gingival recession and exposure of dentine. Other tooth wear processes, notably attrition and acid erosion, cause loss of enamel and can expose dentine. Therefore, sensitivity may result. How lesions of dentine hypersensitivity are initiated is a matter of conjecture and based on extrapolating data from studies, mainly in vitro, to effect in vivo. Again, this circumstantial type of evidence suggests that abrasion by some toothpastes and erosion by dietary acid could open the tubule system. Little is known about the actual effect of de-sensitising toothpastes on lesions of dentine hypersensitivity even though they are formulated to either occlude dentinal tubules or block the neural response in the pulp. Clinical studies have produced contradictory findings for the efficacy of products and there have been extremely few evidence-based reviews. In conclusion, available evidence supports a probable link of tooth brushing, with or without toothpaste and an acidic diet, to both tooth wear and dentine hypersensitivity, and also suggests that dentine hypersensitivity is a tooth wear phenomenon. Although there is a need for more direct clinical and scientific evidence for these associations, it is recommended that they be taken into consideration when planning management strategies for the dentine hypersensitivity sufferer.},

  abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) is an ancient human disease~which mainly affects the lungs, making pulmonary disease the most common presentation. However, TB is a multi-systemic disease with a protean presentation. The organs systems most commonly affected include the respiratory systems, the gastrointestinal system, the lymphoreticular system, the skin, the central nervous system, the musculoskeletal system, the reproductive system, and the liver. Evidence of TB has been reported in~human remains dated thousands of years~(Hershkovitz et al., 2017). For a~human pathogen with no environmental reservoir, tuberculosis has honed the art of survival and has persisted in human communities from antiquity through modern time. In the past few decades, there has been a concerted global effort to eradicate TB. These efforts had yielded some positive dividends especially since 2000 when the World ~Health Organization (WHO 2017) estimated that that global incidence rate for tuberculosis has fallen by 1.5\% every year. Furthermore, mortality arising from tuberculosis has significantly and steadily declined. The World Health Organization (WHO, 2016) reports a 22\% drop in global TB mortality from 2000 through 2015. Despite the gains in tuberculosis control and the decline in both new cases and mortality, TB still accounts for a huge burden of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The bulk of the global burden of new infection and tuberculosis death is borne by developing countries with six countries,~India, Indonesia, China, Nigeria, Pakistan, and South Africa, accounting for 60\% of TB death in 2015, (WHO, 2017). Tuberculosis remains~a significant cause of both illness and death in developed countries especially among individuals with a suppressed immune system. People with HIV are particularly vulnerable to death due to tuberculosis. Tuberculosis accounted for 35\% of global mortality in individuals with HIV/AIDS in 2015. (W.H.O, 2017). Children are also vulnerable, and tuberculosis was responsible for one million~illnesses in children in 2015 according to the WHO.},

  abstract = {Each of us has felt afraid, and we can all recognize fear in many animal species. Yet there is no consensus in the scientific study of fear. Some argue that 'fear' is a psychological construct rather than something discoverable through scientific investigation. Others argue that the term 'fear' cannot properly be applied to animals because we cannot know whether they feel afraid. Studies in rodents show that there are highly specific brain circuits for fear, whereas findings from human neuroimaging seem to make the opposite claim. Here, I review the field and urge three approaches that could reconcile the debates. For one, we need a broadly comparative approach that would identify core components of fear conserved across phylogeny. This also pushes us towards the second point of emphasis: an ecological theory of fear that is essentially functional. Finally, we should aim even to incorporate the conscious experience of being afraid, reinvigorating the study of feelings across species. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

Four types of papillae, filiform, fungiform, vallate and foliate, were observed. Filiform papillae consisted of larger main papillae with smaller secondary papillae on their anterolateral aspects. Secondary papillae were well distributed over the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, but were very rare or absent in the posterior third. Fungiform papillae were distributed among the filiform papillae, being larger and more abundant on the tip of the tongue. Vallate papillae were round-flat or long-flat, surrounded by a prominent circular groove and a thin annular pad. An important finding was the presence of distinct and prominent foliate papillae on the posterolateral sides of the tongue. Keratinisation of the covering stratified squamous epithelium was relatively weak. Taste buds were observed in the epithelium of the fungiform, vallate and foliate papillae. The lingual papillae of the lesser mouse deer showed some characteristics that differed from those reported for domestic ruminants. These may be related to the feeding habits and the type of food eaten by this species.},

In addition to being enzymatically inefficient, RuBisCo has a problem with distinguishing between CO2 and O2. The fixation of O2 results in the energetically wasteful reaction of photorespiration. Thus, there is a strong incentive to improve RuBisCo's catalytic properties by engineering. However, for decades, it has been impossible to express the enzyme from plants in an easily manipulatable bacterial host. Aigner et al. succeeded in functionally expressing plant RuBisCo in Escherichia coli (see the Perspective by Yeates and Wheatley). This should allow for the systematic mutational analysis of RuBisCo and selection of favorable variants for improved crop yields. Science , this issue p. [1272][1]; see also p.

Attachment behavior and explora- tion are viewed in balance, and the biological functions of each are dis- cussed. As an illustration of these concepts, a study is reported of 56 white, middle-class infants, 49-51 weeks of age, in a strange situation. The pres- ence of the mother was found to encourage exploratory behavior, her ab- sence to depress exploration and to heighten attachment behaviors. In sep- aration episodes such behaviors as crying and search increased. In reunion episodes proximity-seeking and contact-maintaining behaviors were height- ened. In a substantial proportion of Ss, contact-resisting behaviors were also heightened in the reunion episodes, usually in conjunction with contact- maintaining behaviors, thus suggesting ambivalence. Some Ss also displayed proximity-avoiding behavior in relation to the mother in the reunion epi- sodes. These findings are discussed in the context of relevant observational, clinical, and experimental studies of human and nonhuman primates, in- cluding studies of mother-child separation. In conclusion, it is urged that the concepts of attachment and attachment behavior be kept broad enough to comprehend the spectrum of the findings of this range of studies.},

After Ainsworth left London, her research in Uganda and in Baltimore lent empirical support to Bowlby's theoretical constructions.

  abstract = {Research dealing with various aspects of the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1985, 1987) is reviewed, and some unresolved issues are discussed. In broad terms, the theory is found to be well supported by empirical evidence. Intentions to perform behaviors of different kinds can be predicted with high accuracy from attitudes toward the behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control; and these intentions, together with perceptions of behav- ioral control, account for considerable variance in actual behavior. Attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control are shown to be related to appropriate sets of salient behavioral, normative, and control beliefs about the behavior, but the exact nature of these relations is still uncertain. Expectancy- value formulations are found to be only partly successful in dealing with these relations. Optimal rescahng of expectancy and value measures is offered as a means of dealing with measurement limitations. Finally, inclusion of past be- havior in the prediction equation is shown to provide a means of testing the theory’s sufficiency, another issue that remains unresolved. The limited avail- able evidence concerning this question shows that the theory is predicting behavior quite well in comparison to the ceiling imposed by behavioral reli- ability.},

The health status of 02 chimpanzees in the Mahale Mountains National Park, Tanzania was evaluated non–invasively using standard behavioural observation and parasitological analysis of stool samples. Based on these data, individuals were classified as being either healthy or sick. Behavioural sequences were analysed and shown to exhibit long!range power law correlations. The behavioural sequences of individuals in healthy and sick states were quantitatively evaluated using detrended fluctuation analysis of social and non–social behaviours within behavioural sequences. These values were compared and significant differences in long–range correlations were found between health states. Sex differences were also noted, with female social behaviour displaying a larger fractal dimension than male social behaviour. The fractal dimension of females declined significantly in sick individuals. This analysis of behaviour provides a new and effective non–invasive method to record and evaluate the general state of health and related stress of animals in the wild. Possible applications of this method in captive situations include the monitoring and evaluating of stress levels over time.},

After several reports documented a steep decline in the population, the US Fish and Wildlife Service developed a recovery plan, including captive breeding and reintroduction. Captive breeding efforts were to be focused on providing animals for future reintroduction to protected areas on Key Largo. However, little was known about the husbandry needs or reproductive behavior of this elusive nocturnal species. In 2005, Disney's Animal Kingdom(®) received 11 animals and began to systematically investigate methods of breeding Key Largo woodrats. Since the program's inception, 30 pups have been born and successfully parent reared. In this report, we describe some of the husbandry techniques that have contributed to the success of the Key Largo woodrat captive breeding program at Disney's Animal Kingdom(®) . The results obtained may be of use to other facilities maintaining woodrats and other rodent species.},

  abstract = {Social perception refers to initial stages in the processing of information that culminates in the accurate analysis of the dispositions and intentions of other individuals. Single-cell recordings in monkeys, and neurophysiological and neuroimaging studies in humans, reveal that cerebral cortex in and near the superior temporal sulcus (STS) region is an important component of this perceptual system. In monkeys and humans, the STS region is activated by movements of the eyes, mouth, hands and body, suggesting that it is involved in analysis of biological motion. However, it is also activated by static images of the face and body, suggesting that it is sensitive to implied motion and more generally to stimuli that signal the actions of another individual. Subsequent analysis of socially relevant stimuli is carried out in the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex, which supports a three-structure model proposed by Brothers. The homology of human and monkey areas involved in social perception, and the functional interrelationships between the STS region and the ventral face area, are unresolved issues.

Problems arising from the interaction of personalities are social problems, and personality measurements aim at readjustments, beneficial both to society and the individual. An effort has been made to consider only "those fundamental and pervasive tendencies which constitute the main currents of human personality" rather than superficial traits, such as tactfulness, which can be referred to more fundamental traits. A tentative outline of such tendencies falls into four main divisions; first, intelligence, which determines the quality and success of an individual's general adjustments; second, temperament, as judged by emotional breadth and emotional strength; third, self-expression or strength, terms which are used to include such traits as extro-version or intro-version, ascendance or submission, expansion or seclusion, compensation, insight and self-evaluation; fourth, sociality, comprising social participation, self-seeking, and susceptibility to social stimuli. Possibly the above traits "form the needed basis of sociability, habit formation and character." When traits are rated or, if possible, tested, they can be plotted in graphical form, giving a refined impression of the individual which facilitates intelligent treatment.

  abstract = {Herbivory is a major source of plant stress and its effects can be severe, decreasing plant fitness, or subtle, affecting the development of leaves by influencing the normal pattern of growth and expansion of leaf blades. Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) analysis is recognized as a measure of plant stress, and can be used to evaluate subtle effects of herbivory on the imperfect growth of bilaterally symmetrical traits, such as leaves. One general issue is that authors usually consider FA as an indicator of stress, which can attract herbivores (plant stress hypothesis), and studies showing that herbivores themselves affect leaf symmetry (herbivory-induced stress hypothesis) are scarce, with mixed results. Here, we investigated the relationship between herbivory by thrips and leaf FA in Banisteriopsis malifolia and Heteropterys escallonifolia (Malpighiaceae). Pseudophilothrips obscuricornis is a free-living, non-pest, sucking species that feeds mainly on leaf buds. We hypothesized that herbivory by thrips in the early stages of leaf development would provoke increased FA levels in mature leaves. The results showed that thrips herbivory rate was low, affecting barely more than 1\% of the leaf blade. Nonetheless, thrips-attacked leaves of B. malifolia and H. escallonifolia presented increases of 15 and 27\% in leaf asymmetry, respectively, compared to uninjured leaves, corroborating the herbivory-induced stress hypothesis. Since herbivory by thrips in leaf buds was related to significant increases in the stress of mature leaves, we assume that under these circumstances, FA can be used as a biomarker for plant stress following herbivory damage. To be useful as a biomarker of stress, FA in plants must be investigated with caution, taking into account the natural history of the herbivore species and timing of leaf damage.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this research was to explore the effects of risperidone on cognitive processes in children with autism and irritable behavior. METHOD: Thirty-eight children, ages 5-17 years with autism and severe behavioral disturbance, were randomly assigned to risperidone (0.5 to 3.5 mg/day) or placebo for 8 weeks. This sample of 38 was a subset of 101 subjects who participated in the clinical trial; 63 were unable to perform the cognitive tasks. A double-blind placebo-controlled parallel groups design was used. Dependent measures included tests of sustained attention, verbal learning, hand-eye coordination, and spatial memory assessed before, during, and after the 8-week treatment. Changes in performance were compared by repeated measures ANOVA. RESULTS: Twenty-nine boys and 9 girls with autism and severe behavioral disturbance and a mental age {$>$}or=18 months completed the cognitive part of the study. No decline in performance occurred with risperidone. Performance on a cancellation task (number of correct detections) and a verbal learning task (word recognition) was better on risperidone than on placebo (without correction for multiplicity). Equivocal improvement also occurred on a spatial memory task. There were no significant differences between treatment conditions on the Purdue Pegboard (hand-eye coordination) task or the Analog Classroom Task (timed math test). CONCLUSION: Risperidone given to children with autism at doses up to 3.5 mg for up to 8 weeks appears to have no detrimental effect on cognitive performance.},

  abstract = {Young women are a group at high risk of weight gain. This study examined a range of perceived personal, social and environmental barriers to physical activity and healthy eating for weight maintenance among young women, and how these varied by socioeconomic status (SES), overweight status and domestic situation. In October-December 2001, a total of 445 women aged 18–32 years, selected randomly from the Australian electoral roll, completed a mailed self-report survey that included questions on 11 barriers to physical activity and 11 barriers to healthy eating (relating to personal, social and environmental factors). Height, weight and socio-demographic details were also obtained. Statistical analyses were conducted mid-2003. The most common perceived barriers to physical activity and healthy eating encountered by young women were related to motivation, time and cost. Women with children were particularly likely to report a lack of social support as an important barrier to physical activity, and lack of social support and time as important barriers to healthy eating. Perceived barriers did not differ by SES or overweight status. Health promotion strategies aimed at preventing weight gain should take into account the specific perceived barriers to physical activity and healthy eating faced by women in this age group, particularly lack of motivation, lack of time, and cost. Strategies targeting perceived lack of time and lack of social support are particularly required for young women with children.},

  abstract = {Since the 19th century, there has been disagreement over the fundamental question of whether "emotions" are cause or consequence of their associated behaviors. This question of causation is most directly addressable in genetically tractable model organisms, including invertebrates such as Drosophila. Yet there is ongoing debate about whether such species even have "emotions," as emotions are typically defined with reference to human behavior and neuroanatomy. Here, we argue that emotional behaviors are a class of behaviors that express internal emotion states. These emotion states exhibit certain general functional and adaptive properties that apply across any specific human emotions like fear or anger, as well as across phylogeny. These general properties, which can be thought of as "emotion primitives," can be modeled and studied in evolutionarily distant model organisms, allowing functional dissection of their mechanistic bases and tests of their causal relationships to behavior. More generally, our approach not only aims at better integration of such studies in model organisms with studies of emotion in humans, but also suggests a revision of how emotion should be operationalized within psychology and psychiatry. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

One issue with EE programs seems to be habituation to the enrichment device. To study the effect of habituation to EE, 14 captive sloth bears (Melursus ursinus) were subjected to two different EE treatments. Treatment one presented EE (logs with honey containing holes) for five consecutive days, whereas treatment two presented EE on intermittent days for five days. Intermittent presentations tended to reduce habituation toward the EE. Both consecutive and intermittent presentations significantly reduced stereotypies; however, the consecutive presentations had a longer-lasting effect. Explorative behaviors increased in both treatments, consistent with earlier findings that EE increase levels of natural behaviors. Other behaviors were unaffected by the EE presentations. The results show that intermittent presentation of EE objects may secure the interest of the animals, but continuous access to enrichment may be more efficient in reducing stereotypies in the long run.},

Further, this study endeavours to examine the terminology and instruments utilized in longitudinal IU and PIU research and investigate whether statistically significant results have arisen from the areas of research focus. In a total of 29 studies, trends in the research of adolescent/emergent adult IU and PIU were discovered. These trends were conceptualized into individual, contextual and activity-related factors. Findings suggested that individual factors are the most researched and have demonstrated significant relationships with adolescent/young adult PIU. However, more research on contextual and activity-related factors is needed in order to achieve a clearer understanding of young people's IU and PIU behaviours, and to incorporate into a comprehensive model that will guide future research in this growing field.},

The success of these microorganisms to survive in nature and complete their enzootic cycle depends on the regulation of genes that are essential to their survival in the different environments. This review describes the current knowledge of gene expression by B. burgdorferi in the tick and the mammalian host. The functions of the differentially regulated gene products as well as the factors that influence their expression are discussed. A thorough understanding of the changes in gene expression and the function of the differentially expressed antigens during the life cycle of the spirochete will allow a better control of this prevalent infection and the design of new, second generation vaccines to prevent infection with the spirochete. © 2003 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

Thorndike's (1920) general evaluative bias (halo) model and J. M. Digman's (1997) higher order personality factors (alpha and beta) model. With 4 multitrait-multimethod analyses, Study 1 revealed moderate convergent validity for alpha and beta across raters, whereas halo was mainly a unique factor for each rater. In Study 2, the authors showed that the halo factor was highly correlated with a validated measure of evaluative biases in self-ratings. Study 3 showed that halo is more strongly correlated with self-ratings of self-esteem than self-ratings of the Big Five, which suggests that halo is not a mere rating bias but actually reflects overly positive self-evaluations. Finally, Study 4 demonstrated that the halo bias in Big Five ratings is stable over short retest intervals. Taken together, the results suggest that the halo-alpha-beta model integrates the main findings in structural analyses of Big Five correlations. Accordingly, halo bias in self-ratings is a reliable and stable bias in individuals' perceptions of their own attributes. Implications of the present findings for the assessment of Big Five personality traits in monomethod studies are discussed.},

  abstract = {Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), a 41 amino acid-containing peptide, appears to mediate not only the endocrine but also the autonomic and behavioral responses to stress. Stress, in particular early-life stress such as childhood abuse and neglect, has been associated with a higher prevalence rate of affective and anxiety disorders in adulthood. In the present review, we describe the evidence suggesting that CRF is hypersecreted from hypothalamic as well as from extrahypothalamic neurons in depression, resulting in hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and elevations of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of CRF. This increase in CRF neuronal activity is also believed to mediate certain of the behavioral symptoms of depression involving sleep and appetite disturbances, reduced libido, and psychomotor changes. The hyperactivity of CRF neuronal systems appears to be a state marker for depression because HPA axis hyperactivity normalizes following successful antidepressant treatment. Similar biochemical and behavioral findings have been observed in adult rats and monkeys that have been subjected to early-life stress. In contrast, clinical studies have not revealed any consistent changes in CSF CRF concentrations in patients with anxiety disorders; however, preclinical findings strongly implicate a role for CRF in the pathophysiology of certain anxiety disorders, probably through its effects on central noradrenergic systems. The findings reviewed here support the hypothesis that CRF receptor antagonists may represent a novel class of antidepressants and/or anxiolytics.},

There are at least 2 ways to correct errors. One is to change the behavior (for example, reduce backbiting and bad-mouthing among individuals). The second way to correct errors is to change the underlying, or master program, that leads individuals to bad-mouth others even when they say they do not intend to do so. If actions are changed without changing the master programs individuals use to produce the actions, then the correction will either fail or will not persevere.

The localisationist tradition has associated one cognitive function - inhibition - by turns with dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), inferior frontal cortex (IFC), or orbital frontal cortex (OFC). Inhibition is postulated to be a mechanism by which PFC exerts its effects on subcortical and posterior-cortical regions to implement executive control. We review evidence concerning inhibition of responses and task-sets. Whereas neuroimaging implicates diverse PFC foci, advances in human lesion-mapping support the functional localization of such inhibition to right IFC alone. Future research should investigate the generality of this proposed inhibitory function to other task domains, and its interaction within a wider network.},

  abstract = {Objectives—This longitudinal study examined the prevalence and correlates of energy drink use among college students, and investigated its possible prospective associations with subsequent drug use, including nonmedical prescription drug use. Methods—Participants were 1,060 undergraduates from a large, public university who completed three annual interviews, beginning in their first year of college. Use of energy drinks, other caffeinated products, tobacco, alcohol, and other illicit and prescription drugs were assessed, as well as demographic and personality characteristics. Results—Annual weighted prevalence of energy drink use was 22.6\%wt and 36.5\%wt in the second and third year of college, respectively. Compared to energy drink non-users, energy drink users had heavier alcohol consumption patterns, and were more likely to have used other drugs, both concurrently and in the preceding assessment. Regression analyses revealed that Year 2 energy drink use was significantly associated with Year 3 nonmedical use of prescription stimulants and prescription analgesics, but not with other Year 3 drug use, holding constant demographics, prior drug use, and other factors. Conclusions—A substantial and rapidly-growing proportion of college students use energy drinks. Energy drink users tend to have greater involvement in alcohol and other drug use and higher levels of sensation-seeking, relative to non-users of energy drinks. Prospectively, energy drink use has a unique relationship with nonmedical use of prescription stimulants and analgesics. More research is needed regarding the health risks associated with energy drink use in young adults, including their possible role in the development of substance use problems. Keywords},

  abstract = {Protected areas are extremely important for the long term viability of biodiversity in a densely populated country like India where land is a scarce resource. However, protected areas cover only 5\% of the land area in India and in the case of large carnivores that range widely, human use landscapes will function as important habitats required for gene flow to occur between protected areas. In this study, we used photographic capture recapture analysis to assess the density of large carnivores in a human-dominated agricultural landscape with density {$>$}300 people/km(2) in western Maharashtra, India. We found evidence of a wide suite of wild carnivores inhabiting a cropland landscape devoid of wilderness and wild herbivore prey. Furthermore, the large carnivores; leopard (Panthera pardus) and striped hyaena (Hyaena hyaena) occurred at relatively high density of 4.8±1.2 (sd) adults/100 km(2) and 5.03±1.3 (sd) adults/100 km(2) respectively. This situation has never been reported before where 10 large carnivores/100 km(2) are sharing space with dense human populations in a completely modified landscape. Human attacks by leopards were rare despite a potentially volatile situation considering that the leopard has been involved in serious conflict, including human deaths in adjoining areas. The results of our work push the frontiers of our understanding of the adaptability of both, humans and wildlife to each other's presence. The results also highlight the urgent need to shift from a PA centric to a landscape level conservation approach, where issues are more complex, and the potential for conflict is also very high. It also highlights the need for a serious rethink of conservation policy, law and practice where the current management focus is restricted to wildlife inside Protected Areas.},

  abstract = {We examined the efficacy of a translocation program in which large numbers of leopards (Panthera pardus fusca) were trapped in human-dominated landscapes where livestock attacks were common and human attacks rare and released into adjoining forested areas in an attempt to reduce leopard presence and mitigate conflicts at the capture site. In the year starting in February of 2001, 29 leopards were captured in the human-dominated rural landscape of the Junnar region (4275 km(2) , 185 people/km(2) ), Maharashtra, India, and released an average of 39.5 km away in adjoining forests. Eleven leopards were also relocated to the same forests from other districts. Prior to the large-scale translocation program, an average of four leopard attacks on humans occurred each year between 1993 and 2001. After the translocation program was initiated, the average increased substantially to 17 attacks. Linear and logistic models showed that attack frequency increased in Junnar following nearby releases of leopards and decreased when leopards were removed for releases far away; that attacks became more lethal when the number of leopards introduced from other districts increased; and that attacks were most likely to occur in the regions where the largest number of leopards had been introduced from other areas. These results suggest that leopards did not stay at the release sites and that translocation induced attacks on people. Potential explanations for these results include increased aggression induced by stress of the translocation process, movement through unfamiliar human-dominated landscapes following release, and loss of fear of humans due to familiarity with humans acquired during captivity. Our results show that reactive solutions to attacks on humans by leopards, such as translocation, could in fact increase human-leopard conflict. Measures to reduce human-carnivore conflicts may include more effective compensation procedures to pay livestock owners for the loss of animals to predation by carnivores, providing better methods of protection for livestock, and encouraging greater social acceptance of the presence of carnivores in human-dominated landscapes.},

  abstract = {A European Endangered Species Programme (EEP) was established in the early 1990s, in order to manage a captive population of Asian lions (Panthera leo leo) within European zoos. The founders of this population comprised of nine individuals that originated from a captive population in India. During 2007–2009, 57 lions were born in the European captive population. Of these births, 35 individuals died within 20 days, three died within two months and one individual was euthanased at four months old. Indeed, over 50\% of the total historical captive population died within 30 days of birth. The ‘European Studbook for the Asian Lion' shows that the EEP founder population contains individuals from matings of full and half siblings, including all female founders. It is probable that high levels of inbreeding within this captive population are causing high levels of stillbirths and infant mortality. Previous research has shown that there is limited genetic variation in the captive population in India. This study uses the same microsatellite markers to establish the level of genetic variation that was present when the EEP population was established in comparison with that observed in the Indian zoo population, from which it was derived. Only three of the 12 microsatellite markers, showing variation in the Indian captive population, showed bi-allelic heterozygosity in the EEP founders, indicating that most variation was not present during the establishment of the EEP population. Therefore, the future of the Asian lion EEP is compromised by lack of genetic variation and high levels of inbreeding, which can only be alleviated by importing further individuals with different genotypes from India.},

  abstract = {Recently introduced unmarked spatial capture-recapture (SCR), spatial mark-resight (SMR), and 2-flank spatial partial identity models (SPIM) extend the domain of SCR to populations or observation systems that do not always allow for individual identity to be determined with certainty. For example, some species do not have natural marks that can reliably produce individual identities from photographs, and some methods of observation produce partial identity samples as is the case with remote cameras that sometimes produce single flank photographs. These models share the feature that they probabilistically resolve the uncertainty in individual identity using the spatial location where samples were collected. Spatial location is informative of individual identity in spatially structured populations with home range sizes smaller than the extent of the trapping array because a latent identity sample is more likely to have been produced by an individual living near the trap where it was recorded than an individual living further away from the trap. Further, the level of information about individual identity that a spatial location contains is determined by two key ecological concepts, population density and home range size. The number of individuals that could have produced a latent or partial identity sample increases as density and home range size increase because more individual home ranges will overlap any given trap. We show this uncertainty can be quantified using a metric describing the expected magnitude of uncertainty in individual identity for any given population density and home range size, the Identity Diversity Index (IDI). We then show that the performance of latent and partial identity SCR models varies as a function of this index and produces imprecise and biased estimates in many high IDI scenarios when data are sparse. We then extend the unmarked SCR model to incorporate partially identifying covariates which reduce the level of uncertainty in individual identity, increasing the reliability and precision of density estimates, and allowing reliable density estimation in scenarios with higher IDI values and with more sparse data. We illustrate the performance of this "categorical SPIM" via simulations and by applying it to a black bear data set using microsatellite loci as categorical covariates, where we reproduce the full data set estimates with only slightly less precision using fewer loci than necessary for confident individual identification. The categorical SPIM offers an alternative to using probability of identity criteria for classifying genotypes as unique, shifting the "shadow effect", where more than one individual in the population has the same genotype, from a source of bias to a source of uncertainty. We discuss the difficulties that real world data sets pose for latent identity SCR methods, most importantly, individual heterogeneity in detection function parameters, and argue that the addition of partial identity information reduces these concerns. We then discuss how the categorical SPIM can be applied to other wildlife sampling scenarios such as remote camera surveys, where natural or researcher-applied partial marks can be observed in photographs. Finally, we discuss how the categorical SPIM can be added to SMR, 2-flank SPIM, or other future latent identity.},

  abstract = {The main aim of the present study was to explore the significance of large group/greater pen housing (PH) versus standard Makrolon caging (ST) in three behaviour tests related to human-animal interactions in the adult male laboratory rat. The rats' perception of human interaction was tested in three behavioural tests, of which two reflected common practical procedures, capture and restraint, whereas the third was a human approach test in a Y-maze. The rats' anticipatory reactions to handling and the reactions to restraint did not differ between groups, but the ST rats approached a human hand more quickly than did the PH rats (P {$<$} 0.01). Although food intake did not differ, ST rats gained more weight (P {$<$} 0.01) and had higher total cholesterol values (P {$<$} 0.01) than PH rats. In conclusion, this study shows that housing rats in large groups in an enriched environment did not influence their anticipatory reaction to handling in normal handling situations. However, as the PH rats tended to have a longer approach latency than ST rats in the Y-maze there might be underlying differences in appraisal that are not detected in practical situations. In addition, the PH rats weighed less and had lower total cholesterol values than ST rats and their urine corticosterone values were higher. These effects are suggested to be due to higher physical activity in the PH rats, and the implications of this on the animal as a model is discussed.},

I studied female mate choice in house sparrows Passer domesticus in relation to the size of the black throat patch of males (badge size), which is a signal of dominance status, and to terri-tory quality. Males with large badges obtained a mate earlier in spring than males with small badges. Males which remained unmated during the entire breeding season had smaller badges than mated males, even when controlling for the effect of other morphological traits and age. Large-badged males had territories with more breeding sites than small-badged males. Territories defended by males with large badges primarily had hole nest sites, which were safe from predators, and nestlings rarely fell from hole nests. Females were implanted with estradiol to induce copulation solicitation dis-plays. Females responded more strongly to a male taxidermic mount and song than to song alone, and they responded more strongly and frequently to male mounts with large badges. Female house sparrows chose mates on the basis of male badges and perhaps on the basis of the quality of the nest-ing territories offered.},

Dialogue was facilitated by brainstorming sessions in small groups and a \&ldquo;World Caf\&eacute;\&rdquo;. A conclusion from this process was that alternatives to CO2 were urgently required, including a program of research and extension to meet the needs for humane killing of these animals. The next step will involve gathering a group of international experts to formulate, draft, and publish a research strategy on alternatives to CO2.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to develop a welfare assessment tool based on objective, reliable and relevant measures to be applied to individual dogs as they underwent a Catch-Neuter-Return (CNR) programme. A modified Delphi method and Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) approach was used to develop the composite canine welfare assessment protocol, comprising both animal-based and resource-based measures. This draft welfare assessment protocol was then trialed and refined in existing CNR programmes to identify key control points where individual dog welfare may be moderately or significantly compromised in the CNR process. The results show that animal-based welfare indicators, e.g., pain behaviours, which provide a more direct indication of an animal\&rsquo;s welfare state, require training and skill to recognise, whilst resource-based indicators are simple to measure but act only as indirect measures of welfare. We concluded that whilst CNR projects can potentially improve the health and welfare of free-roaming dogs in the long-term, the risk of short-term welfare harms during the CNR process is high. Thus, it is essential for staff involved in dog population management programmes to assess the welfare state of dogs in CNR and take remedial action to safeguard individual dog welfare.},

  abstract = {In order to investigate the potential influence of stress as a component of the repeat breeding syndrome, the adrenocortical capacity for steroid production was evaluated in ovariectomised dairy heifers. In repeat breeder heifers (RBH), marginally elevated plasma progesterone levels during oestrus, so-called suprabasal progesterone levels, have earlier been measured and are believed to impair fertility. The aim was to distinguish if this progesterone could be of extra-gonadal or in this case, adrenal origin. Baseline levels of plasma cortisol and progesterone were determined as well as the corresponding response after induced acute stress in the form of an adrenocorticotropin (ACTH)-challenge. Comparisons were made between strictly selected RBH, n = 5 and virgin heifers (VH), n = 5 of the Swedish Red and White breed. The heifers were used as their own pre-challenge controls in a 2-day trial. On the control day, saline was injected i.v. and on the treatment day, a synthetic analogue of ACTH (60 μg Synachten®). Via a jugular vein catheter, blood samples were collected every 30 min for 6 h each day of the experiment. Analyses for plasma progesterone and cortisol were made. RBH had a significantly higher (P {$<$} 0.01) pretreatment baseline cortisol level (10.1 ± 2.3 nmol 1-1) than VH (2.6 ± 0.2 nmol 1-1). Moreover, the cortisol response after stimuli was stronger in RBH than VH, especially concerning total hormone production (P {$<$} 0.001), but there was also a tendency towards higher peak values (P = 0.06) and longer duration of significantly increased hormone concentrations (P = 0.08). Progesterone concentrations, however, did not differ between the groups. Both baseline levels (P = 0.25) and posttreatment production (P = 0.45) were of the same magnitude in RBH and VH. In conclusion, the study could not confirm that suprabasal progesterone concentrations during oestrus in RBH derive from the adrenal glands. Still, apparent differences were found in adrenocortical activity when ovariectomised heifers, VH and RBH, were subjected to an ACTH-challenge. It is suggested that a sustained adrenal stimulation associated with environmental or social stress could be one factor in the repeat breeding syndrome. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Personality dynamics between individuals may influence cooperative behaviors. Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) live in social communities and cooperate with other conspecifics to achieve goals both in the wild and in human care. We investigated the role that personality plays in the willingness of dolphins to work together. We tested five bottlenose dolphin pairs at the Roatan Institute for Marine Sciences, Honduras, with an apparatus previously used to experimentally test dolphin cooperation. Personality profiles of each dolphin were created using surveys completed by the caretakers, in particular noting two different categories of interactions: dolphin to dolphin and dolphin to world. We hypothesized that dyadic success in the cooperative task would differ based on specific personality traits of individuals. We also hypothesized that the most successful dyads would show similar types of conspecific sociality and different means of interacting with objects. Although none of the dolphin pairs cooperated to open the apparatus, individual personalities were analyzed in relation to the dolphins’ individual and mutual interactions with the apparatus as well as the pairs’ social behaviors. Playfulness, curiosity, and affiliation as well as agreeableness, and extraversion were positively related to affiliation with the apparatus and each other. These findings suggest that certain aspects of personality are indicative of affiliation or interaction by an individual dolphin. These results could guide future animal research on the relationship between personality, social interactions, and problem-solving.},

Whereas the potential provision of economic benefits from ecosystems to people is often quanitified through ecological production functions, the use of and demand for es has received less attention, as have the spatial flows of services from ecosystems to people. Through a case study in Puget Sound, Washington State, USA, we quantify and differentiate between theoretical or in situ provision of services (ie ecosystems' capacity to supply services) and their actual provision when accounting for the location of beneficiaries and the sptial connections that mediate service flows between people and ecosystems. Our analysis includes five ecosystem services: carbon seq and storage, riverine flood regulation, sedimentation regulation for reservoirs, open space proximity, and scenic viewsheds. Each ES is characterized by different beneficiary groups and means of service flow. Using ARIES we map service supply, demand and flow, extending on simpler approaches used by past studies to map service provision and use. With the exception of the carbon seq service, regions that actually provided services to people, ie connected to beneficiaries via flow paths, amounted to 16-66\% of those theoretically capable of supplying services (ie all ecosystems across the landscape). These results offer a more complete understanding of the spatial dynamics of ES and their effects, and may provide a sounder basis for economic valuation and policy applications than studies that consider only theoretical service provision.},

  abstract = {Many wildlife studies seek to understand changes or differences in the proportion of sites occupied by a species of interest. These studies are hampered by imperfect detection of these species, which can result in some sites appearing to be unoc- cupied that are actually occupied. Occupancy models solve this problem and produce unbiased estimates of occupancy and related parameters. Required data (detection/non-detec- tion information) are relatively simple and inexpensive to collect. Software is available free of charge to aid in- vestigators in occupancy estimation},

  abstract = {A new method was devised to test object permanence in young infants. Five- month-old infants were habituated to a screen that moved back and forth through a 180-degree arc, in the manner of a drawbridge. After infants reached habituation, a box was centered behind the screen. Infants were shown two test events: a possible event and an impossible event. In the possible event, the screen stopped when it reached the occluded box; in the impossible event, the screen moved through the space occupied by the box. The results indicated that infants looked reliably longer at the impossible than at the possible event. This finding suggested that infants (1) understood that the box continued to exist, in its same location, after it was occluded by the screen, and (2) expected the screen to stop against the occluded box and were surprised, or puzzled, when it failed to do so. A control experiment in which the box was placed next to the screen provided support for this interpretation of the results. Together, the results of these experiments indicate that, contrary to Piaget's (1954) claims, infants as young as 5 months of age understand that objects continue to exist when occluded. The results also indicate that 5-month-old infants realize that solid objects do not move through the space occupied by other solid objects. © 1985.},

  abstract = {Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and log-linear analyses of time-budget data from a study of sloth bear enclosure utilization are compared. Two sampling models that plausibly underlie such data are discussed. Either could lead to an analysis of variance, but only one to a log-linear analysis. Given an appropriate sampling model and appropriate data, there is much to recommend log-linear analysis, despite its unfamiliarity to most animal behaviorists. One need not worry whether distribution assumptions are violated. Moreover, the data analyzed are the data collected, not estimates derived from those data, and thus no power is lost through a data reduction step. No matter what analysis is used, effect size should be taken into consideration. Multiple R2 can be used for ANOVA, but no directly comparable statistic exists for log-linear analyses. One possible candidate for a log-linear R2 analog is discussed here, and appears to give sensible and interpretable results. © 1992 Wiley-Liss Inc.},

  abstract = {Human-wildlife conflict is a global issue. Attempts to manage this conflict impact upon wild animal welfare, an issue receiving little attention until relatively recently. Where human activities harm animal welfare these effects should be minimised where possible. However, little is known about the welfare impacts of different wildlife management interventions, and opinions on impacts vary widely. Welfare impacts therefore need to be assessed objectively. Our objectives were to: 1) establish whether an existing welfare assessment model could differentiate and rank the impacts of different wildlife management interventions (for decision-making purposes); 2) identify and evaluate any additional benefits of making formal welfare assessments; and 3) illustrate issues raised by application of the model. We applied the welfare assessment model to interventions commonly used with rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), moles (Talpa europaea) and crows (Corvus corone) in the UK. The model ranked interventions for rabbits (least impact first: fencing, head shot, chest shot) and crows (shooting, scaring, live trapping with cervical dislocation). For moles, managing molehills and tunnels scored least impact. Both spring trapping, and live trapping followed by translocation, scored greater impacts, but these could not be compared directly as they scored on different axes of the model. Some rankings appeared counter-intuitive, highlighting the need for objective formal welfare assessments. As well as ranking the humaneness of interventions, the model highlighted future research needs and how Standard Operating Procedures might be improved. The model is a milestone in assessing wildlife management welfare impacts, but our research revealed some limitations of the model and we discuss likely challenges in resolving these. In future, the model might be developed to improve its utility, e.g. by refining the time-scales. It might also be used to reach consensus among stakeholders about relative welfare impacts or to identify ways of improving wildlife management practice in the field.},

The limited resources available for conservation need to be used both effectively and efficiently in order to minimise further losses. Spatial conservation prioritization addresses the question of how we should allocate conservation effort and funds in space and time. While the benefits of quantitative conservation prioritization methods have been widely promoted, adoption of these methods in "real-world" planning and implementation is still in its infancy, partly due to the difficulty of identifying which methods and tools (if any) are suited to specific planning problems. Spatial Conservation Prioritization brings together a team of leading scientists to introduce the conceptual and methodological aspects of how to undertake spatial conservation planning in a quantitative manner. It provides the reader with information on when, why, and how to use which statistical and computational methods for conservation prioritization. Important topics underlying spatial prioritization including metapopulation modelling, population viability analysis modelling, species distribution modelling, and uncertainty analysis are discussed, as well as operational definitions and methods. The book includes chapters on the most widely used and latest software, and concludes with an insight into the future of the field.},

  abstract = {Although high rates of anthropogenic mortality are often reported for carnivores near reserve borders, the resulting edge effects are rarely quantified, and the consequences on conservation goals are usually unknown. Here, we assess the extent and impact of edge effects on a protected leopard Panthera pardus population in the Phinda-Mkhuze Complex (PMC), South Africa. We compared the spatial and demographic characteristics of leopards in two areas of the PMC, one closer to the border than the other. Leopard density declined from the core of the reserve (11.11 ± 1.31 leopards 100 km-2) to the border (7.17 ± 1.12 leopards 100 km-2), and was the lowest in non-protected areas adjoining the PMC (2.49 ± 0.87 leopards 100 km-2), but was not related to prey abundance or interspecific competition. Radiotelemetry showed that leopards near the border spent a greater proportion of their time outside the reserve and suffered higher annual mortality rates (0.358 ± 0.075) than those closer to the core (0.122 ± 0.065). A Cox proportional hazards model further demonstrated the negative effect of time spent outside the reserve on the survival probability of leopards. Despite an increased risk of mortality, leopards did not avoid non-protected areas, which may have functioned as an ecological trap for predators. Although the overall conservation outcome of the reserve was positive, edge effects clearly weakened the potential of the PMC to protect leopards. Our findings show that high mortality rates of carnivores in areas bordering reserves can extend to protected populations. Management approaches that control human activities on both sides of administrative borders are therefore essential if reserves are to conserve large carnivores effectively. © 2010 The Authors.

  abstract = {Rarely human communities coexist in harmony with large predators. Most often communities suffer due to predation on their stock while large carnivores suffer losses and at times extirpation due to retaliation. We examine the mechanisms permitting the coexistence of Asiatic lions (Panthera leo persica) and pastoral communities (Maldharis) in the Gir forests, India. We monitored six Maldhari settlements between 2005 and 2007 to quantify seasonal livestock holding, density and losses due to predation and other causes. Lion density, estimated by mark recapture, was 15±0.1 SE/100 km(2). Livestock density, estimated by total counts, ranged between 25/km(2)-31/km(2) with buffaloes being most abundant. Average livestock holding of Maldhari families was 33±3 SE. Lions predated mostly on unproductive cattle (30\%). Scat analysis (n = 165), predation events (n = 180) and seven continuous monitoring sessions of 1,798 hours on four radio-collared lions estimated livestock to contribute between 25 to 42\% of lions' biomass consumptions, of which only 16\% was predated; rest scavenged. With free grazing rights within Gir forests, Maldharis offset 58±0.2 SE\% of annual livestock rearing cost in comparison to non-forest dwelling pastoralists. With government compensation scheme for livestock predation, this profit margin augmented to 76±0.05 SE\%. Lion density was higher in areas with Maldhari livestock in comparison to areas without livestock. Thus, the current lifestyles and livestock holdings of Maldharis seem to be beneficial to both lions and local pastoralists. We conclude that a combination of strict protection regime for lions, Maldharis' traditional reverence towards lions and the livelihood economics permit the delicate balance of lion-Maldhari coexistence. Indefinite increase in human and livestock population within Gir might upset this equilibrium undermining the conservation objectives. We see no end to compensation programs worldwide as they constitute a crucial element needed for human-carnivore coexistence.},

This paper focuses on the performance evaluation process and portfolios selection by using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). Conventional DEA models assume non-negative values for inputs and outputs, but many of data take the negative value. Therefore, we have used our models based on Range Directional Measure (RDM) that can take positive and negative values. Here value at risk is obtained by non-parametric methods such as historical simulation and Monte Carlo simulation. Finally, a numerical example in Iran's market is presented.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Ayahuasca is a traditional South American psychoactive beverage and the central sacrament of Brazilian-based religious groups, with followers in Europe and the United States. The tea contains the psychedelic indole N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and beta-carboline alkaloids with monoamine oxidase-inhibiting properties that render DMT orally active. DMT interacts with serotonergic neurotransmission acting as a partial agonist at 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2A/2C) receptor sites. Given the role played by serotonin in the regulation of the sleep/wake cycle, we investigated the effects of daytime ayahuasca consumption in sleep parameters. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Subjective sleep quality, polysomnography (PSG), and spectral analysis were assessed in a group of 22 healthy male volunteers after the administration of a placebo, an ayahuasca dose equivalent to 1 mg DMT kg(-1) body weight, and 20 mg d-amphetamine, a proaminergic drug, as a positive control. Results show that ayahuasca did not induce any subjectively perceived deterioration of sleep quality or PSG-measured disruptions of sleep initiation or maintenance, in contrast with d-amphetamine, which delayed sleep initiation, disrupted sleep maintenance, induced a predominance of 'light' vs 'deep' sleep and significantly impaired subjective sleep quality. PSG analysis also showed that similarly to d-amphetamine, ayahuasca inhibits rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, decreasing its duration, both in absolute values and as a percentage of total sleep time, and shows a trend increase in its onset latency. Spectral analysis showed that d-amphetamine and ayahuasca increased power in the high frequency range, mainly during stage 2. Remarkably, whereas slow-wave sleep (SWS) power in the first night cycle, an indicator of sleep pressure, was decreased by d-amphetamine, ayahuasca enhanced power in this frequency band. CONCLUSIONS: Results show that daytime serotonergic psychedelic drug administration leads to measurable changes in PSG and sleep power spectrum and suggest an interaction between these drugs and brain circuits modulating REM and SWS.},

In addition, it may balance a low-protein diet in favor of growth, as well as increase resistance to pathogens and to cold exposure. These short-term benefits result from activation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), which is hypothesized to occur during play. SNS activation increases heat production in brown adipose tissue. The energy-regulation approach generates many predictions that are supported in the literature, and others that can be empirically tested.},

Communication with peer group members was the most important motivation for SNS use. Participants high in positive collective self-esteem were strongly motivated to communicate with peer group via SNS. Females were more likely to report high positive collective self-esteem, greater overall use, and SNS use to communicate with peers. Females also posted higher means for group-in-self, passing time, and entertainment. Negative collective self-esteem correlated with social compensation, suggesting that those who felt negatively about their social group used SNS as an alternative to communicating with other group members. Males were more likely than females to report negative collective self-esteem and SNS use for social compensation and social identity gratifications.},

  abstract = {Understanding the phylogeographic processes affecting endangered species is crucial both to interpreting their evolutionary history and to the establishment of conservation strategies. Lions provide a key opportunity to explore such processes; however, a lack of genetic diversity and shortage of suitable samples has until now hindered such investigation. We used mitochondrial control region DNA (mtDNA) sequences to investigate the phylogeographic history of modern lions, using samples from across their entire range. We find the sub-Saharan African lions are basal among modern lions, supporting a single African origin model of modern lion evolution, equivalent to the 'recent African origin' model of modern human evolution. We also find the greatest variety of mtDNA haplotypes in the centre of Africa, which may be due to the distribution of physical barriers and continental-scale habitat changes caused by Pleistocene glacial oscillations. Our results suggest that the modern lion may currently consist of three geographic populations on the basis of their recent evolutionary history: North African-Asian, southern African and middle African. Future conservation strategies should take these evolutionary subdivisions into consideration.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous meta-analyses comparing the efficacy of psychotherapeutic interventions for depression were clouded by a limited number of within-study treatment comparisons. This study used network meta-analysis, a novel methodological approach that integrates direct and indirect evidence from randomised controlled studies, to re-examine the comparative efficacy of seven psychotherapeutic interventions for adult depression.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted systematic literature searches in PubMed, PsycINFO, and Embase up to November 2012, and identified additional studies through earlier meta-analyses and the references of included studies. We identified 198 studies, including 15,118 adult patients with depression, and coded moderator variables. Each of the seven psychotherapeutic interventions was superior to a waitlist control condition with moderate to large effects (range d{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}-0.62 to d{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}-0.92). Relative effects of different psychotherapeutic interventions on depressive symptoms were absent to small (range d{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.01 to d{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}-0.30). Interpersonal therapy was significantly more effective than supportive therapy (d{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}-0.30, 95\% credibility interval [CrI] [-0.54 to -0.05]). Moderator analysis showed that patient characteristics had no influence on treatment effects, but identified aspects of study quality and sample size as effect modifiers. Smaller effects were found in studies of at least moderate (Δd{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.29 [-0.01 to 0.58]; p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.063) and large size (Δd{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.33 [0.08 to 0.61]; p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.012) and those that had adequate outcome assessment (Δd{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.38 [-0.06 to 0.87]; p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.100). Stepwise restriction of analyses by sample size showed robust effects for cognitive-behavioural therapy, interpersonal therapy, and problem-solving therapy (all d{$>$}0.46) compared to waitlist. Empirical evidence from large studies was unavailable or limited for other psychotherapeutic interventions.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: Overall our results are consistent with the notion that different psychotherapeutic interventions for depression have comparable benefits. However, the robustness of the evidence varies considerably between different psychotherapeutic treatments.},

  abstract = {Lion (Panthera leo) populations have dramatically decreased worldwide with a surviving population estimated at 32,000 across the African savannah. Lions have been kept in captivity for centuries and, although they reproduce well, high rates of stillbirths as well as morbidity and mortality of neonate and young lions are reported. Many of these cases are associated with bone malformations, including foramen magnum (FM) stenosis and thickened tentorium cerebelli. The precise causes of these malformations and whether they are unique to captive lions remain unclear. To test whether captivity is associated with FM stenosis, we evaluated 575 lion skulls of wild (N = 512) and captive (N = 63) origin. Tiger skulls (N = 276; 56 captive, 220 wild) were measured for comparison. While no differences were found between males and females or between subadults and adults in FM height (FMH), FMH of captive lions (17.36±3.20 mm) was significantly smaller and with greater variability when compared to that in wild lions (19.77±2.11 mm). There was no difference between wild (18.47±1.26 mm) and captive (18.56±1.64 mm) tigers in FMH. Birth origin (wild vs. captive) as a factor for FMH remained significant in lions even after controlling for age and sex. Whereas only 20/473 wild lions (4.2\%) had FMH equal to or smaller than the 5th percentile of the wild population (16.60 mm), this was evident in 40.4\% (23/57) of captive lion skulls. Similar comparison for tigers found no differences between the captive and wild populations. Lions with FMH equal to or smaller than the 5th percentile had wider skulls with smaller cranial volume. Cranial volume remained smaller in both male and female captive lions when controlled for skull size. These findings suggest species- and captivity-related predisposition for the pathology in lions.},

In captivity, they spend most time on exhibit sleeping or pacing. To better understand their activity budget, this study examined the daily behavior patterns of 2 Sumatran tigers and 3 African lions in different housings. The proportion of scans the large felids spent engaged in stereotypic pacing varied by time of day and environment. The tigers spent different amounts of time pacing when housed in different exhibits; the lions paced more in off-exhibit housing than when on exhibit. These differences suggest changes to the cats' immediate housing environment may decrease pacing but provide little insight into altering specifics. Carnivores' pacing relates to their inability to control sensory access to social partners. Both environments with increased pacing contained chain-link fencing. allowing uncontrolled sensory contact. Where the tigers paced, the study placed a visual barrier between one female and keepers' or conspecifics' cues. This did not significantly decrease pacing. However, the study suggests considering sensory access and environmental variables when designing environments for captive carnivores.},

  abstract = {An understanding of species ecology is vital for effective conservation, particularly if the species forms an important constituent of the lesser mammal guild and regulates small mammal and bird populations. As the ecological role of the leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis) in the intricate eastern Himalayan habitats is not known, we assessed the site occupancy, detection probability and activity pattern of leopard cats in Khangchendzonga Biosphere Reserve, India, based on sign surveys and camera trapping. The estimated site occupancy was 0.352 +/- 0.061 and detection probability was 0.143 +/- 0.0484. Occupancy modelling indicated low elevation, high rodent abundance and tree cover as best predictors for the occupancy of leopard cat. Diet based on analysed scats revealed murids as the most dominant prey (89.2 \%). Information based on photographic captures indicated that the leopard cat exhibited a nocturnal activity pattern (peak activity between 0200-0300 hours), which coincided with its principal prey (revealed through diet analysis), but mainly contradicted with other sympatric competitors, hence indicating a temporal partitioning of resources among them. Ecological niche factor analysis indicated that the leopard cat exhibits high global marginality (1.32) and low global tolerance (0.275). The habitat suitability map for leopard cats showed majority of the habitat as unsuitable (1,959.44 km(2)) and predicted only 164.54 km(2) areas of lower temperate forests as moderate to highly suitable. As highly suitable habitats of the leopard cat are in close proximity to villages, conflict issues are a major threat and therefore need to be addressed in conservation program for this felid},

  abstract = {Context Although impunity for those responsible for trauma is widely thought to be associated with psychological problems in survivors of political violence, no study has yet investigated this issue. Objective To examine the mental health and cognitive effects of war trauma and how appraisal of redress for trauma and beliefs about justice, safety, other people, war cause, and religion relate to posttraumatic stress responses in war survivors. Design, Setting, and Participants A cross-sectional survey conducted between March 2000 and July 2002 with a population-based sample of 1358 war survivors who had experienced at least 1 war-related stressor (combat, torture, internal displacement, refugee experience, siege, and/or aerial bombardment) from 4 sites in former Yugoslavia, accessed through linkage sampling. Control groups at 2 study sites were matched with survivors on sex, age, and education. Main Outcome Measures Semi-structured Interview for Survivors of War, Redress for Trauma Survivors Questionnaire, Emotions and Beliefs After War questionnaire, Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV). Results The mean (SD) age was 39 (12) years, 806 (59\%) were men, and 339 (25\%) had high school or higher level of education. Participants reported experiencing a mean of 12.6 war-related events, with 292 (22\%) and 451 (33\%) having current and lifetime posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), respectively, and 129 (10\%) with current major depression. A total of 1074 (79\%) of the survivors reported a sense of injustice in relation to perceived lack of redress for trauma. Perceived impunity for those held responsible for trauma was only one of the factors associated with sense of injustice. Relative to controls, survivors had stronger emotional responses to impunity, greater fear and loss of control over life, less belief in benevolence of people, greater loss of meaning in war cause, stronger faith in God, and higher rates of PTSD and depression. Fear and loss of control over life were associated with PTSD and depression (odds ratio OR, 2.91; 95\% CI, 2.27-3.74 and OR, 2.30; 95\% CI, 1.75-3.03, respectively), and emotional responses to impunity showed a relatively weaker association with PTSD (OR, 1.53; 95\% CI, 1.16-2.02) and depression (OR, 1.39; 95\% CI, 1.02-1.91). Appraisal of redress for trauma was not associated with PTSD or depression. Conclusions PTSD and depression in war survivors appear to be independent of sense of injustice arising from perceived lack of redress for trauma. Fear of threat to safety and loss of control over life appeared to be the most important mediating factors in PTSD and depression. These findings may have important implications for reconciliation efforts in postwar countries and effective interventions for traumatized war survivors},

However, housing systems for laboratory animals have often been designed on the basis of economic and ergonomic aspects. One possible way to improve the living conditions of laboratory animals is to provide opportunities for the animals to perform a species-specific behavioral repertoire. Environmental enrichment should be regarded both as an essential component of the overall animal care program and equally important as nutrition and veterinary care. The key component of an enrichment program is the animal staff, whose members must be motivated and educated. It is critically important to evaluate environmental enrichment in terms of the benefit to the animal by assessing the use of and preference for a certain enrichment, the effect on behavior and the performance of species-typical behavior, and the effect on physiological parameters. At the same time, it is necessary to evaluate the impact on scientific outcome, how the enrichment influences the scientific study, and whether and how the statistical power is affected. The result will depend on the parameter measured, the type of enrichment used, and the animal strain. In this article, goals of enrichment are defined and discussed. Animal behaviors and needs are described, along with the translation of those needs into environmental enrichment programs. Specific types of environmental enrichment are outlined with examples from the literature, and an evaluation of environmental enrichment is provided.},

  abstract = {The current revival of the American economy is being predicated on social distancing, specifically the Six-Foot Rule, a guideline that offers little protection from pathogen-bearing aerosol droplets sufficiently small to be continuously mixed through an indoor space. The importance of airborne transmission of COVID-19 is now widely recognized. While tools for risk assessment have recently been developed, no safety guideline has been proposed to protect against it. We here build on models of airborne disease transmission in order to derive an indoor safety guideline that would impose an upper bound on the “cumulative exposure time,” the product of the number of occupants and their time in an enclosed space. We demonstrate how this bound depends on the rates of ventilation and air filtration, dimensions of the room, breathing rate, respiratory activity and face mask use of its occupants, and infectiousness of the respiratory aerosols. By synthesizing available data from the best-characterized indoor spreading events with respiratory drop size distributions, we estimate an infectious dose on the order of 10 aerosol-borne virions. The new virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) is thus inferred to be an order of magnitude more infectious than its forerunner (SARS-CoV), consistent with the pandemic status achieved by COVID-19. Case studies are presented for classrooms and nursing homes, and a spreadsheet and online app are provided to facilitate use of our guideline. Implications for contact tracing and quarantining are considered, and appropriate caveats enumerated. Particular consideration is given to respiratory jets, which may substantially elevate risk when face masks are not worn.},

  abstract = {The newest addition to the highly regarded Helm Identification Series, which includes Seabirds ("unparalleled achievement," "best bird guide of any kind or of any generation," "sets the standard of excellence") and Shorebirds ("a superb guide," "a landmark volume"). One of the most eagerly awaited bird books in recent decades, Raptors is the first complete identification guide to all the birds of prey of the world. Each of the 313 species is described thoroughly and accurately, and every plumage and variation is shown in more than two thousand color illustrations plus hundreds of black-and-white drawings. Both large-scale and small-scale range maps show in detail where each species has been found. Like all the other identification guides in the Helm series including Seabirds, Shorebirds, Warblers of the Americas, Waterfowl, Woodpeckers, and Sparrows and Buntings Raptors is the definitive book on its subject. The birds of prey are arguably the most fascinating group of birds for birders and nonbirders alike, and Raptors will be an essential reference for anyone with an interest in birds.},

  abstract = {Two groups of beagles, accustomed to spacious group housing, were subjected to social and spatial restriction and studied for manifestations of chronic stress with a time interval of 7 weeks between the groups. The change from outside group housing (the control period) to individual housing in small indoor kennels resulted in sustained decreases in urinary adrenaline/creatinine and noradrenaline/creatinine ratios for the total group. Urinary dopamine/creatinine and noradrenaline/adrenaline ratios were statistically unaffected. Socially and spatially restricted dogs that had experienced pleasant weather during the control period showed (a) increased salivary and urinary cortisol concentrations, (b) a diminished responsiveness of the pituitary-adrenal axis to a sudden sound blast or exogenous CRH, (c) intact plasma ACTH and cortisol suppressions after dexamethasone administration, and (d) increased concanavalin A induced lymphocyte proliferations. When social and spatial restriction was preceded by a control period during which the weather was bad, these physiological responses were either augmented (lymphocyte proliferation), or offset (salivary and urinary cortisol), or directed oppositely (CRH-induced ACTH and cortisol responses). Together with the previously presented behavioral observations, these data suggest that bad weather conditions during spacious outdoor group housing induced early stress that attenuated the negative appraisal of the subsequent period of social and spacial restriction. In comparison to male dogs, bitches showed increased HPA responses to a sound blast or exogenous CRH. Their increased attenuations of the ACTH and cortisol responses to CRH after 5 weeks of restricted housing indicates that bitches are not only more susceptible to acute stress, but also to chronic housing stress. It is concluded that the quality of circumstances preceding a period of affected well-being determines the magnitude and even the direction of the behavioral and physiological stress responses. Basal salivary and urinary cortisol measurements are useful for the assessment of chronic stress, and of poor welfare in dogs. The use of urinary catecholamine, peripheral leucocyte, and lymphocyte proliferation measures requires further investigation. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Inc.},

A principal component analysis was performed using two variables per device as active variables and 26 others as supplementary variables. The first factor was clearly due to opposition between high and low levels of neophobia. Only variables from the first two tests were strongly correlated to this factor. Variables from the holeboard and from the plus maze were highly correlated one another and with the second factor, which grouped locomotion and exploration criteria. The light/dark choice test was intermediate and seemed to be moderately related to both locomotion and neophobia. These results point out the difficulty in comparing different test devices from a psychological point of view. ?? 1994.},

Neonatal medical risk and other prenatal exposures (alcohol, cigarettes, and marijuana) were also examined for their unique effects on child IQ. Mixed models analysis indicated that prenatal cocaine exposure interacted with gender, as cocaine-exposed boys had lower composite IQ scores. Age at assessment did not moderate this relation, indicating that cocaine-exposed boys had lower IQs across this age period. A stimulating home environment and high maternal verbal IQ also predicted higher composite IQ scores. Cocaine-exposed boys had lower scores on the Abstract/Visual Reasoning subscale, with trends for lower scores on the Short-Term Memory and Verbal Reasoning subscales, as exposure effects were observed across domains. The findings indicate that cocaine exposure continues to place children at risk for mild cognitive deficits into preadolescence. Possible mechanisms for the Exposure x Gender interaction are discussed.},

Recently, the PSTF (now called the Pedigree Standardization Work Group or PSWG) sought evidence that the published symbols met the needs of health professionals, were incorporated into health professional training and were utilized in publications. We searched PubMed and reference lists of select publications, reviewed the Instructions for Authors of several journals, searched the websites of professional societies, sought comment from the membership of the NSGC, and looked at recommendations and training practices of various health professional organizations. Many journals still do not cite specific standards for pedigrees, but those found cited the PSTF nomenclature. We did not find significant objections or alternatives to the 1995 nomenclature. Based on our review, we propose only a few minor stylistic changes to the pedigree symbols. The pedigree nomenclature of the NSGC is the only consistently acknowledged standard for drawing a family health history. We recommend regular and continued review of these pedigree standards to determine if additional symbols are needed to accommodate changes in clinical practice to ensure that the symbols continue to meet the needs of health professionals and researchers as well as adhere to evolving ethical and privacy standards. All health professionals, trainees, and researchers should be made aware of the utility of using a common pedigree nomenclature in clinical practice and publication. This will become particularly important as electronic medical records become more widely utilized.},

  abstract = {Twenty-one multiparous sows were used in a Latin square design, from days 7 to 90 of gestation, to test the effect of fibre and food levels on feeding motivation and feeding-related stereotypies. Treatments were: VHF (very high-fibre, 29\% ADF, 50\% NDF, 4.5kg/day); HF (high-fibre, 23\% ADF, 43\% NDF, 3.5kg/day); C (control, 8\% ADF, 20\% NDF, 2.5kg/day); and control fed ad libitum (CAL). All diets except CAL provided a similar amount of major nutrients on a daily basis and were served in two meals. Each sow was subjected to each treatment for a 21-day period, at the end of which, behavioural observations were made. Two-hour observation periods starting at the afternoon food delivery revealed that sows spent more time eating on VHF and CAL (mean=21.2min) than on HF (13.2min) and C (7.6min) and more time on HF compared to C (p{$<$}0.01). When time spent eating was removed from total observation time, the percentage of remaining time spent in stereotypies was lower for VHF (median=17.9\%) compared to C (median=49.8\%), and lower for CAL (median=6.3\%) compared to all other diets (p{$<$}0.01). During the period when lights were on (6.00-18.00h), 5min interval scans showed that VHF sows spent more time lying down and less time standing than C sows (p{$<$}0.05). Also, CAL sows spent more time lying down than sows on other treatments (p{$<$}0.01). During operant conditioning tests (OCT) performed before the afternoon meal and after the morning meal, less rewards were obtained by CAL sows (p{$<$}0.01), with no difference between other treatments. In conclusion, no reduction in feeding motivation of sows fed high-fibre diets could be measured by OCT, but very high levels of fibre were effective at reducing stereotypies and activity during the 2h post-feeding. However, these effects were not as marked as those observed with ad libitum feeding.},

  abstract = {Epidemiological and experimental studies have revealed that a mild to moderate drinking of wine, particularly red wine, attenuates the cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular risk. However, the experimental basis for such health benefits is not fully understood. The cardioprotective effect of wine has been attributed to both components of wine: the alcoholic portion and, more importantly, the alcohol-free portion containing antioxidants. Wines are manufactured from grapes, which also contain a large variety of antioxidants, including resveratrol, catechin, epicatechin, and proanthocyanidins. Resveratrol is mainly found in the grape skin, whereas proanthocyanidins are found only in the seeds. Recent studies have demonstrated that resveratrol and proanthocyanidin are the major compounds present in grapes and wines responsible for cardioprotection. The purpose of this review is to provide evidence that grapes, wines, and resveratrol are equally important in reducing the risk of morbidity and mortality due to cardiovascular complications. Both wines and grapes can attenuate cardiac diseases such as atherosclerosis and ischemic heart disease. Recently, wine was also found to increase life span by inducing longevity genes. It appears that resveratrol and proanthocyanidins, especially resveratrol, present in grapes and wines play a crucial role in cardioprotective abilities of grapes and wines.},

These effects were examined separately for evaluative measures that were relevant as well as irrelevant to the salient status distinctions. The results support social identity theory and show that high-status groups are more biased. The meta-analysis reveals that perceived status stability, legitimacy, and permeability moderate the effects of group status. Also, these variables interacted in their influences on the effect of group status on in-group bias, but this was only true for irrelevant evaluative dimensions. When status was unstable and perceived as illegitimate, low-status groups and high-status groups were equally biased when group boundaries were impermeable, compared with when they were permeable. Implications for social identity theory as well as for intergroup attitudes are discussed.},

This 20 item self reported questionnaire has often been used in patients with chronic fatigue. To date, no research has focused on the validity of the CIS in occupational groups. METHODS: To evaluate the discriminant validity the CIS was filled out by five groups of employees with expected differences in fatigue. The convergent validity was evaluated by comparing the results of the CIS with the results of three related measures: measured unidimensional fatigue, burnout, and need for recovery. RESULTS: The CIS was able to discriminate between fatigued and non-fatigued employees in occupational groups. The expected agreement between the results of the CIS and related measures was confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: The CIS seems to be an appropriate instrument for measuring fatigue in the working population.},

  abstract = {Executive functions supported by prefrontal cortical (PFC) systems provide essential control and planning mechanisms to guide goal-directed behavior. As such, age-related alterations in executive functions can mediate profound and widespread deficits on a diverse array of neurocognitive processes. Many of the critical neuroanatomical and functional characteristics of prefrontal cortex are preserved in rodents, allowing for meaningful cross species comparisons relevant to the study of cognitive aging. In particular, as rodents lend themselves to genetic, cellular and biochemical approaches, rodent models of executive function stand to significantly contribute to our understanding of the critical neurobiological mechanisms that mediate decline of executive processes across the lifespan. Moreover, rodent analogs of executive functions that decline in human aging represent an essential component of a targeted, rational approach for developing and testing effective treatment and prevention therapies for age-related cognitive decline. This paper reviews behavioral approaches used to study executive function in rodents, with a focus on those assays that share a foundation in the psychological and neuroanatomical constructs important for human aging. A particular emphasis is placed on behavioral approaches used to assess working memory and cognitive flexibility, which are sensitive to decline with age across species and for which strong rodent models currently exist. In addition, other approaches in rodent behavior that have potential for providing analogs to functions that reliably decline to human aging (e.g., information processing speed) are discussed.},

Different types of aggressive behaviour were measured with peer nomination techniques, supported by self-ratings. The social structure of the peer groups were also studied. The results of the 11-year-old cohort were previously presented by Lagerspetz et al. [1988; Aggressive Behavior 14:403-414], but they are compared here with the other age groups. The principal finding was that girls of the two older cohorts overall make greater use of indirect means of aggression, whereas boys tend to employ direct means. Previously, the main difference between the genders has been thought to be that boys use physical aggressive strategies, while girls prefer verbal ones. Our studies suggest that the differentiation between direct and indirect strategies of aggression presents a more exact picture. Indirect aggressive strategies were not yet fully developed among the 8-year-old girls, but they were already prominent among the 11-year-old girls. Aggressive behaviour was assessed overall by the children themselves to be the highest in this age group.},

  abstract = {Social interactions serve as an evolutionarily important source of stress, and one that is virtually ubiquitous among mammalian species. Animal models of social stress are varied, ranging from a focus on acute, intermittent, or chronic exposure involving agonistic behavior, to social isolation. The relative stressfulness of these experiences may depend on the species, sex, and age of the subjects, and subject sex also appears to influence the value of hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis activity as a general criterion for stress response: higher glucocorticoid levels are typically found in dominant females in some species. Social stress models often produce victorious and defeated, or dominant and subordinate, animals that may be compared to each other or to controls, but the appropriateness of specific types of comparisons and the interpretations of their differences may vary for the different models. Social stress strongly impacts behavior, generally reducing aggression and enhancing defensiveness, both inside and outside the stress situation. Social and sexual behaviors may be reduced in subordinate animals, as is activity and responsivity to normally rewarding events. However, some components of these changes may be dependent on the presence of a dominant, rather than representing a longer-term and general alteration in behavior. Social stress effects on brain neurotransmitter systems have been most extensively investigated, and most often found in serotonin and noradrenergic systems, with changes also reported for other monoamine and for peptidergic systems. Morphological changes and alterations of neogenesis and of cell survival particularly involving the hippocampus and dentate gyrus have been reported with severe social stress, as have longer-term changes in HPA axis functioning. These findings indicate that social stress models can provide high magnitude and appropriate stressors for research, but additionally suggest a need for caution in interpretation of the findings of these models and care in analysis of their underlying mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Intense multidisciplinary research has provided detailed knowledge of the molecular pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD). This knowledge has been translated into new therapeutic strategies with putative disease-modifying effects. Several of the most promising approaches, such as amyloid-beta immunotherapy and secretase inhibition, are now being tested in clinical trials. Disease-modifying treatments might be at their most effective when initiated very early in the course of AD, before amyloid plaques and neurodegeneration become too widespread. Thus, biomarkers are needed that can detect AD in the predementia phase or, ideally, in presymptomatic individuals. In this Review, we present the rationales behind and the diagnostic performances of the core cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for AD, namely total tau, phosphorylated tau and the 42 amino acid form of amyloid-beta. These biomarkers reflect AD pathology, and are candidate markers for predicting future cognitive decline in healthy individuals and the progression to dementia in patients who are cognitively impaired. We also discuss emerging plasma and CSF biomarkers, and explore new proteomics-based strategies for identifying additional CSF markers. Furthermore, we outline the roles of CSF biomarkers in drug discovery and clinical trials, and provide perspectives on AD biomarker discovery and the validation of such markers for use in the clinic.},

Food items were selected on the basis of their contribution to total population intake of energy and each of 17 nutrients in the NHANES II data, and represent over 90\% of each of those nutrients. Associated nutrient composition values were determined from the NHANES II database using frequency of consumption data in that survey. Portion sizes to be associated with each food item were derived from observed portion size distributions in NHANES II, based on three-dimensional models. The resulting food list and its corresponding brief data base, when used to calculate nutrients from a diet record, yielded correlations of r greater than 0.70 with the more detailed method.

  abstract = {The movement of animals in groups is widespread in nature. Understanding this phenomenon presents an important problem in ecology with many applications that range from conservation to robotics. Underlying all group movements are interactions between individual animals and it is therefore crucial to understand the mechanisms of this social behaviour. To date, despite promising methodological developments, there are few applications to data of practical statistical techniques that inferentially investigate the extent and nature of social interactions in group movement. We address this gap by demonstrating the usefulness of a Hidden Markov Model approach to characterise individual-level social movement in published trajectory data on three-spined stickleback shoals (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and novel data on guppy shoals (Poecilia reticulata). With these models, we formally test for speed-mediated social interactions and verify that they are present. We further characterise this inferred social behaviour and find that despite the substantial shoal-level differences in movement dynamics between species, it is qualitatively similar in guppies and sticklebacks. It is intermittent, occurring in varying numbers of individuals at different time points. The speeds of interacting fish follow a bimodal distribution, indicating that they are either stationary or move at a preferred mean speed, and social fish with more social neighbours move at higher speeds, on average. Our findings and methodology present steps towards characterising social behaviour in animal groups.},

We predicted instead that gender differences in support will be moderated by stress, and that men will provide lower-quality support primarily when their stress is high. We predicted further that the detrimental effects of stress on men's support will be more evident when men are responding to women's emotionally toned expressions of stress than when men are responding to women's affectively neutral expressions of stress. Stressed and unstressed men and women were observed providing support to a stressed relationship partner. While unstressed, men and women generally provided similar support to the stressed partner. While stressed, men provided lower-quality support than did comparably stressed women, but only in response to emotionally toned expressions of stress. Thus, gender differences in support may arise because women are better able than men to regulate other people's emotional distress while managing stresses of their own.},

Patients appear to “act out their dreams,” in which the exhibited behaviors mirror the content of the dreams, and the dream content often involves a chasing or attacking theme. The polysomnographic features of RBD include increased electromyographic tone +/- dream enactment behavior during REM sleep. Management with counseling and pharmacologic measures is usually straight-forward and effective. In this review, the terminology, clinical and polysomnographic features, demographic and epidemiologic features, diagnostic criteria, differential diagnosis, and management strategies are discussed. Recent data on the suspected pathophysiologic mechanisms of RBD are also reviewed. The literature and our institutional experience on RBD are next discussed, with an emphasis on the RBD-neurodegenerative disease association and particularly the RBD-synucleinopathy association. Several issues relating to evolving concepts, controversies, and future directions are then reviewed, with an emphasis on idiopathic RBD representing an early feature of a neurodegenerative disease and particularly an evolving synucleinopathy. Planning for future therapies that impact patients with idiopathic RBD is reviewed in detail.},

  abstract = {Most mouthwashes contain alcohol, a known cause of head and neck cancer (oral cavity, pharynx, larynx), likely through the carcinogenic activity of acetaldehyde, formed in the oral cavity from alcohol. We carried out a pooled analysis of 8981 cases of head and neck cancer and 10 090 controls from 12 case-control studies with comparable information on mouthwash use in the International Head and Neck Cancer Epidemiology Consortium. Logistic regression was used to assess the association of mouthwash use with cancers of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx, adjusting for study, age, sex, pack-years of tobacco smoking, number of alcoholic drinks/day, and education. Compared with never users of mouthwash, the odds ratio (OR) of all head and neck cancers was 1.01 [95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.94-1.08] for ever users, based on 12 studies. The corresponding ORs of cancer of the oral cavity and oropharynx were 1.11 (95\% CI: 1.00-1.23) and 1.28 (95\% CI: 1.06-1.56), respectively. OR for all head and neck cancer was 1.15 (95\% CI: 1.01-1.30) for use for more than 35 years, based on seven studies (P for linear trend=0.01), and OR 1.31 (95\% CI: 1.09-1.58) for use more than one per day, based on five studies (P for linear trend {$<$}0.001). Although limited by the retrospective nature of the study and the limited ability to assess risks of mouthwash use in nonusers of tobacco and alcohol, this large investigation shows potential risks for head and neck cancer subsites and in long-term and frequent users of mouthwash. This pooled analysis provides the most precise estimate of the association between mouthwash use and head and neck cancer.},

Nonnormal data such as counts or proportions often defy classical statistical procedures. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) provide a more flexible approach for analyzing nonnormal data when random effects are present. The explosion of research on GLMMs in the last decade has generated considerable uncertainty for practitioners in ecology and evolution. Despite the availability of accurate techniques for estimating GLMM parameters in simple cases, complex GLMMs are challenging to fit and statistical inference such as hypothesis testing remains difficult. We review the use (and misuse) of GLMMs in ecology and evolution, discuss estimation and inference and summarize ‘best-practice’ data analysis procedures for scientists facing this challenge.},

The present paper focuses on the accuracy and robustness of several correction algorithms for the conserved variables, which has become a crucial ingredient in the numerical simulation of problems where the magnetic pressure dominates over the thermal pressure by more than two orders of magnitude.Two versions of non-relativistic and fully relativistic corrections have been tested and compared using a magnetized cylindrical explosion with high magnetization (???104) as test. In the non-relativistic corrections, the total energy is corrected for the difference in the classical magnetic energy term between the average of the staggered fields and the conservative ones, before (CA1) and after (CA1') recovering the primitive variables. These corrections are unable to pass the test at any numerical resolution. The two relativistic approaches (CA2 and CA2'), correcting also the magnetic terms depending on the flow speed in both the momentum and the total energy, reveal as much more robust. These algorithms pass the test successfully and with very small deviations of the energy conservation (???10-4), and very low values of the total momentum (???10-8). In particular, the algorithm CA2' (that corrects the conserved variables after recovering the primitive variables) passes the test at all resolutions.The numerical code used to run all the test cases is briefly described.},

  abstract = {Reviews the book, Mind, Meaning, and Mental Disorder: The Nature of Causal Explanation in Psychology and Psychiatry, 2nd ed by Derek Bolton and Jonathan Hill (2004). In the epistemological spirit of trying to make (human) order out of (natural) disorder, this ambitious book attempts to trace the logic-oriented striving of psychology and psychiatry to apply observation, statistics, and logic to the chaotic phenomena of the mentally ill mind. Clinicians seeking research or even anecdotal evidence of best practices will be entirely disappointed because these pages offer abstractions only and no immediately applicable hypotheses or data. However, if the reader is open-hearted and willing to adventure into the overlapping realms of theoretical philosophy and medical nosology, then there may be surprising rewards at the conclusion. Tracking the lines of thought requires consistent attention; this is not a book to be casually perused in bits and pieces over a protracted period of time. The development of the fundamental intellectual pursuit here starts with the intent of the authors to elucidate the bases of "action," conceptualized as likely related to neural causation. In this model, empathy is merely the subjective re-creation of the electrochemical objective existence of the other person. Some of the logic is primarily semantic, and other aspects are firmly rooted in known physics and molecular biology. At the end, anxiety, schizophrenia, and personality disorders are deconstructed, and throughout, the examination is conducted with true passion and inspiration. The reviewer suggests that this book is not for everyone. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Primary care physicians are positioned to provide early recognition and treatment of dementia. We evaluated the feasibility and utility of a comprehensive screening and diagnosis program for dementia in primary care. METHODS: We screened individuals aged 65 and older attending 7 urban and racially diverse primary care practices in Indianapolis. Dementia was diagnosed according to International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 criteria by an expert panel using the results of neuropsychologic testing and information collected from patients, caregivers, and medical records. RESULTS: Among 3,340 patients screened, 434 scored positive but only 227 would agree to a formal diagnostic assessment. Among those who completed the diagnostic assessment, 47\% were diagnosed with dementia, 33\% had cognitive impairment—no dementia (CIND), and 20\% were considered to have no cognitive deficit. The overall estimated prevalence of dementia was 6.0\% (95\% confidence interval (CI) 5.5\% to 6.6\%) and the overall estimate of the program cost was \$128 per patient screened for dementia and \$3,983 per patient diagnosed with dementia. Only 19\% of patients with confirmed dementia diagnosis had documentation of dementia in their medical record. CONCLUSIONS: Dementia is common and undiagnosed in primary care. Screening instruments alone have insufficient specificity to establish a valid diagnosis of dementia when used in a comprehensive screening program; these results may not be generalized to older adults presenting with cognitive complaints. Multiple health system and patient-level factors present barriers to this formal assessment and thus render the current standard of care for dementia diagnosis impractical in primary care settings.},

  abstract = {Background: Mental health is a central determinant of quality of life. While psychiatric morbidity of populations has been studied extensively, the role of perceived stress, social support, and internal resources as determinant of health is still poorly understood. Methods: We surveyed 2000 randomly selected university students. Perceived stress was measured by the Brief Encounter Psychosocial Instrument, social support by the Duke-UNC Functional Social Support Questionnaire, internal resources (mastery and self-esteem) by a brief version of the Pearlin coping questionnaire. Linear regression models were used to explore the relationships between these variables and mental health, based on the SF-12 health survey. Results: After two reminders, 1257 students answered the questionnaire. In bivariate analysis, mental health was negatively associated with stress and positively associated with internal resources and social support (all p-values {$<$} 0.001). In multiple regression analysis, internal resources were positively associated with mental health, and buffered the negative impact of stress on mental health. Internal resources and stress mediated the positive impact of social support on mental health. Conclusions: Our data confirm that perceived stress is an important risk factor for low mental health and suggest that mastery and self-esteem are important protective factors of mental health among young adults.},

The indicator system focuses on landscape factors that limit or enhance an ecosystem’s ability to provide services and that limit or enhance the expected value of those services. The analysis yields an organized, descriptive, and numerical depiction of sites involved in specific mitigation projects. Indicatorbased evaluations are applied to existing wetland mitigation projects in Florida and Maryland in order to practically illustrate the virtues and limitations of the approach.},

We independently analyzed data from 10 never-published studies that examined the impact of zoo visitors on zoo animal behavior. Of the 16 species studied, 90.9\% of the mammal species and 60.0\% of the fish species demonstrated a change in at least one behavior based on zoo visitor abundance or visitor behavior (e.g., noise, solicitation of interactions from zoo animals). In addition, behavioral changes associated with zoo visitors were present in animals housed in exhibits where there was direct contact with zoo visitors, as well as in exhibits where there was indirect contact and no direct contact. Individuals often varied in their behavioral responses, and some individuals appeared to seek out interactions with visitors. Our findings demonstrate that short-term research projects can provide valuable insight into individual animal-level and species-level responses to visitor abundance and visitor behavior in the zoo setting. We recommend that behavioral assessments focus on the analysis of behaviors of individual animals whenever possible, and we recommend that exhibits provide areas that allow for animals to retreat from the public view.},

In contrast, the majority of instructors did not provide regular warnings over the course topics that might trigger students, and most instructors had neutral or negative opinions about trigger warnings. Overall, the results suggest that most Abnormal Psychology instructors do not view trigger warnings as essential to the teaching of sensitive topics.},

  abstract = {Marketing cattle through auctions increases marketing time, exposing animals to more stressful events. Within Chile, 37\% of auctioned cattle are \&ldquo;calves\&rdquo;. To assess factors that may be affecting the welfare of calves during movement and penning, twelve markets were visited to evaluate behavioral indicators of welfare, handling, and facilities. Behavioral indicators during movement were classified into movement and other behaviors, and indicators during penning were classified into positive or negative behavioral welfare indicators. For each group of calves, an index was calculated based on a proportion of observed behavioral indicators. Statistical models were built to identify variables associated with changes in these indices. Presence of inappropriate driving, inadequate lighting, and slippery floor was associated with a movement index increase (poorer welfare). Negative tactile interactions were associated with an increase, and group size was associated with a decrease in movement index and other behavior indices. During penning, not mixing animals from different sources was associated with an increase and stocking density with a decrease in positive welfare index. Number of auctioned cattle, observation number, and not mixing with incompatible and/or with calves from different sources were factors associated with a decrease in negative welfare index, and the presence of males was associated with an increase. Behavioral welfare indicators were mostly associated with handling.},

  abstract = {Reintroduction of captive-bred animals is a key approach in conservation attempts for many endangered species, however, post-release survival is often low. Rearing conditions may be unlike those encountered upon release and the animals may not have had experiences necessary for survival in the wild. Animals may also habituate in captivity to stimuli that may pose a danger after release and/or there may be selection for behavioural traits, in particular reduced fearfulness, that may not be suited for the wild. Here, variation in boldnesswas assessed in captive-bred swift fox (Vulpes velox) and tested for influence on survival after release. Radio-tracked individuals that died in the 6 months following release were those judged previously as bold. In the presence of novel stimuli in captivity, they had left their dens more quickly, approached more closely to the stimuli and shown more activities indicating low fear than did those that survived. These individuals were less suited for release. Future selection of release-candidates on the basis of behavioural variation should enhance the success of reintroduction programmes.},

  abstract = {Much of the early structural definition of the cell wall of Mycobacterium spp. was initiated in the 1960s and 1970s. There was a long period of inactivity, but more recent developments in NMR and mass spectral analysis and definition of the M. tuberculosis genome have resulted in a thorough understanding, not only of the structure of the mycobacterial cell wall and its lipids but also the basic genetics and biosynthesis. Our understanding nowadays of cell-wall architecture amounts to a massive "core" comprised of peptidoglycan covalently attached via a linker unit (L-Rha-D-GlcNAc-P) to a linear galactofuran, in turn attached to several strands of a highly branched arabinofuran, in turn attached to mycolic acids. The mycolic acids are oriented perpendicular to the plane of the membrane and provide a truly special lipid barrier responsible for many of the physiological and disease-inducing aspects of M. tuberculosis. Intercalated within this lipid environment are the lipids that have intrigued researchers for over five decades: the phthiocerol dimycocerosate, cord factor/dimycolyltrehalose, the sulfolipids, the phosphatidylinositol mannosides, etc. Knowledge of their roles in "signaling" events, in pathogenesis, and in the immune response is now emerging, sometimes piecemeal and sometimes in an organized fashion. Some of the more intriguing observations are those demonstrating that mycolic acids are recognized by CD1-restricted T-cells, that antigen 85, one of the most powerful protective antigens of M. tuberculosis, is a mycolyltransferase, and that lipoarabinomannan (LAM), when "capped" with short mannose oligosacchaddes, is involved in phagocytosis of M. tuberculosis. Definition of the genome of M. tuberculosis has greatly aided efforts to define the biosynthetic pathways for all of these exotic molecules: the mycolic acids, the mycocerosates, phthiocerol, LAM, and the polyprenyl phosphates. For example, we know that synthesis of the entire core is initiated on a decaprenyl-P with synthesis of the linker unit, and then there is concomitant extension of the galactan and arabinan chains while this intermediate is transported through the cytoplasmic membrane. The final steps in these events, the attachment of mycolic acids and ligation to peptidoglycan, await definition and will prove to be excellent targets for a new generation of antituberculosis drugs. © 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

Explorative and bold behaviours often covary with contest behaviour and outcome, although there is evidence that the structure of these behavioural syndromes' can change across situations. Aggression itself is typically repeatable, but also subject to high within-individual variation as a consequence of plastic responses to previous fight outcomes and opponent traits. Common proximate mechanisms (gene expression, endocrine control and metabolic rates) may underpin variation in both contest behaviour and general personality traits. Given the theoretical links between the evolution of fighting and of personality, we suggest that longitudinal studies of contest behaviour, combining behavioural and physiological data, would be a useful context for the study of animal personalities.},

Inbreeding reduces reproductive fitness in naturally outbreeding species, but its role in extinctions of wild populations is controversial. To evaluate critically the role of inbreeding in extinction, we conducted realistic population viability analyses of 20 threatened species, with and without inbreeding depression, using initial population sizes of 50, 250, and 1000. Inbreeding markedly decreased median times to extinction by 28.5, 30.5, and 25\% for initial populations of 50, 250, and 1000, respectively, and the impacts were similar across major taxa. The major variable explaining differences among species was initial population growth rate, whereas the impact of inbreeding was least in species with negative growth rates. These results demonstrate that the prospects for survival of threatened species will usually be seriously overestimated if genetic factors are disregarded, and that inappropriate recovery plans may be instituted if inbreeding depression is ignored.},

It can also be used as a basis for listing species as endangered under World Conservation Union criteria5. However, there is considerable scepticism regarding the predictive accuracy of PVA, mainly because of a lack of validation in real systems2,6,7,8. Here we conducted a retrospective test of PVA based on 21 long-term ecological studies—the first comprehensive and replicated evaluation of the predictive powers of PVA. Parameters were estimated from the first half of each data set and the second half was used to evaluate the performance of the model. Contrary to recent criticisms, we found that PVA predictions were surprisingly accurate. The risk of population decline closely matched observed outcomes, there was no significant bias, and population size projections did not differ significantly from reality. Furthermore, the predictions of the five PVA software packages were highly concordant. We conclude that PVA is a valid and sufficiently accurate tool for categorizing and managing endangered species.},

  abstract = {FOR THEIR DISCUSSION OF OUR WORK. 7 WE AGREE WITH THE COMMENTATORS that determining mechanisms of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep motor atonia is of major scientific importance and clini-cal relevance. The concept that REM atonia is under the con-trol of one physiological mechanism and one neurotransmitter pathway has seduced many of us. The undoubted appeal of the current theory—that glycinergic inhibition of motoneurons is the only mechanism mediating REM atonia—is its inher-ent simplicity. However, the fact that several laboratories now provide evidence indicating that glycinergic inhibition plays only a minimal role in mediating REM atonia 7-9 and that other neurotransmitter pathways contribute to motor suppression in REM sleep 10-13 indicates that we need to reevaluate mechanisms of REM atonia. If glycinergic inhibition is indeed the dominat-ing force driving motor inhibition during REM sleep, then why does blockade of glycine receptors at the trigeminal motor pool not prevent REM atonia in masseter muscles? 7 Our work demon-strates that antagonism of glycine and GABA A receptors at the trigeminal motor pool causes a profound increase in masseter muscle tone during both wakefulness and non-rapid eye move-ment (NREM) sleep; however, this same intervention does not prevent or even reverse REM atonia, despite the fact that it po-tently provokes muscle-twitch activity in REM sleep (Figure 1). In fact, REM atonia persists even when glycine and GABA A receptors are blocked and potent glutamatergic agonists are simul-taneously applied to the trigeminal motor pool. We interpret these findings to indicate that (1) glycinergic-and GABA A -mediated inhibition plays a minimal role in triggering REM atonia; (2) inhibition primarily functions to suppress muscle twitches dur-ing REM sleep; and, (3) a powerful, yet unidentified, inhibitory mechanism or mechanisms override excitation during REM sleep. Some commentators offer alternative possibilities for our experimental observations; we respond to these discussion points below.},

  abstract = {Observation of behaviour, especially social behaviour, and experimental studies of learning and brain function give us information about the complexity of concepts that animals have. In order to learn to obtain a resource or carry out an action, domestic animals may: relate stimuli such as human words to the reward, perform sequences of actions including navigation or detours, discriminate amongst other individuals, copy the actions of other individuals, distinguish between individuals who do or do not have information, or communicate so as to cause humans or other animals to carry out actions. Some parrots, that are accustomed to humans but not domesticated, can use words to have specific meanings. In some cases, stimuli, individuals or actions are remembered for days, weeks or years. Events likely to occur in the future may be predicted and changes over time taken into account. Scientific evidence for the needs of animals depends, in part, on studies assessing motivational strength whose methodology depends on the cognitive ability of the animals.Recognition and learning may be associated with changes in physiology, behaviour and positive or negative feelings. Learning and other complex behaviour can result in affect and affect can alter cognition. The demonstration of cognitive bias gives indications about affect and welfare but should be interpreted in the light of other information. All of the information mentioned so far helps to provide evidence about sentience and the level of awareness. The term sentience implies a range of abilities, not just the capacity to have some feelings. The reluctance of scientists to attribute complex abilities and feelings to non-humans has slowed the development of this area of science.Most people consider that they have obligations to some animals. However, they might protect animals because they consider that an animal has an intrinsic value, or because of their concern for its welfare. In social species, there has been selection promoting moral systems that might result in behaviours such as attempts to avoid harm to others, collaboration and other altruistic behaviour. An evaluation of such behaviour may provide one of the criteria for decisions about whether or not to protect animals of a particular species. Other criteria may be: whether or not the animal is known as an individual, similarity to humans, level of awareness, extent of feelings, being large, being rare, being useful or having aesthetic quality for humans. Cognitive ability should also be considered when designing methods of enriching the environments of captive animals. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Data analysis, statistical research, and teaching statistics have at least one thing in common: these activities all produce many files! There are data files, source code, figures, tables, prepared reports, and much more. Most of these files evolve over the course of a project and often need to be shared with others, for reading or edits, as a project unfolds. Without explicit and structured management, project organization can easily descend into chaos, taking time away from the primary work and reducing the quality of the final product. This unhappy result can be avoided by repurposing tools and workflows from the software development world, namely, distributed version control. This article describes the use of the version control system Git and and the hosting site GitHub for statistical and data scientific workflows. Special attention is given to projects that use the statistical language R and, optionally, R Markdown documents. Supplementary materials include an annotated set of links to step-by-step tutorials, real world examples, and other useful learning resources.},

Rumours of its demise are unfounded. Conservation behaviour is quickly building a capacity to positively influence environmental decision making. The theoretical framework used by animal behaviourists is uniquely valuable to elucidating integrative solutions to human-wildlife conflicts, efforts to reintroduce endangered species and reducing the deleterious effects of ecotourism. Conservation behaviourists must join with other scientists under the multidisciplinary umbrella of conservation biology without giving up on their focus: the mechanisms, development, function and evolutionary history of individual differences in behaviour. Conservation behaviour is an increasingly relevant tool in the preservation of nature.},

  abstract = {The second edition of this book is unique in that it focuses on methods for making formal statistical inference from all the models in an a priori set (Multi-Model Inference). A philosophy is presented for model-based data analysis and a general strategy outlined for the analysis of empirical data. The book invites increased attention on a priori science hypotheses and modeling.Kullback-Leibler Information represents a fundamental quantity in science and is Hirotugu Akaike's basis for model selection. The maximized log-likelihood function can be bias-corrected as an estimator of expected, relative Kullback-Leibler information. This leads to Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) and various extensions. These methods are relatively simple and easy to use in practice, but based on deep statistical theory. The information theoretic approaches provide a unified and rigorous theory, an extension of likelihood theory, an important application of information theory, and are objective and practical to employ across a very wide class of empirical problems.The book presents several new ways to incorporate model selection uncertainty into parameter estimates and estimates of precision. An array of challenging examples is given to illustrate various technical issues.This is an applied book written primarily for biologists and statisticians wanting to make inferences from multiple models and is suitable as a graduate text or as a reference for professional analysts.},

  abstract = {Animals bred for captivity often have smaller brains and behave differently than their wild counterparts. These differences in brain size have been attributed to genetic changes resulting from, for example, inbreeding depression and pleiotropic effects of artificial selection for traits such as docility. A critical question, though, is whether these differences in brain size are due to plastic responses to the environment, not just genetic changes. We observed a large reduction in brain size in first generation, lab-reared female guppies compared with wild-caught ones (19\% smaller telencephalon, 17\% smaller optic tectum). We then reared first-generation, lab-born guppies in environments varying in spatial complexity and size in an attempt to isolate factors that might increase brain size and change temperament, but no significant differences in phenotype were observed. The results of these experiments show that, although the environmental factors responsible for the effect have not been found, even first generation lab-reared individuals can have smaller brains than wild individuals.},

However, evolutionary ecologists have put limited effort into validating their tests of temperament. This article attempts to validate three standard tests of temperament in guppies: the open-field test, emergence test, and novel-object test. Through multiple reliability trials, and comparison of results between different types of test, this study establishes the confidence that can be placed in these temperament tests. The open-field test is shown to be a good test of boldness and exploratory behavior; the open-field test was reliable when tested in multiple ways. There were problems with the emergence test and novel-object test, which leads one to conclude that the protocols used in this study should not be considered valid tests for this species.},

  abstract = {Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is a part of the brain's limbic system. Classically, this region has been related to affect, on the basis of lesion studies in humans and in animals. In the late 1980s, neuroimaging research indicated that ACC was active in many studies of cognition. The findings from EEG studies of a focal area of negativity in scalp electrodes following an error response led to the idea that ACC might be the brain's error detection and correction device. In this article, these various findings are reviewed in relation to the idea that ACC is a part of a circuit involved in a form of attention that serves to regulate both cognitive and emotional processing. Neuroimaging studies showing that separate areas of ACC are involved in cognition and emotion are discussed and related to results showing that the error negativity is influenced by affect and motivation. In addition, the development of the emotional and cognitive roles of ACC are discussed, and how the success of this regulation in controlling responses might be correlated with cingulate size. Finally, some theories are considered about how the different subdivisions of ACC might interact with other cortical structures as a part of the circuits involved in the regulation of mental and emotional activity.},

  abstract = {Marmoset wasting syndrome (MWS) describes a series of symptoms in callitrichids that lead to general weakness and a failure to thrive in captive conditions such as zoological institutions. Though the cause of MWS has not been identified, the majority of hypotheses are linked to deficiencies of specific nutrients and increased stress levels. Questionnaires were sent to zoos requesting information on diets and housing of currently living and dead callitrichids before their deaths, as well as their postmortem reports. Risk factors for development and occurrence of MWS include close proximity of predator enclosures and high levels of dietary magnesium and zinc. Variables with effects which may protect against the development of MWS included provision of a nest box, natural trees within enclosure, reduced visibility to visitors, as well as dietary factors such as higher concentrations of potassium and fiber fractions. The protective effects of limited concentrate feeds and increased total dietary fiber may help reduce the risks of developing MWS. The minerals may not have biological implications in MWS per se, however, they may be reflective of diets too high in concentrates and too low in plant matter. Habitat designs that are less naturalistic and those which provide insufficient privacy or hide areas may increase chronic stress for callitrichid species, possibly because of visitor-related stress. Other causes of chronic stress in captive zoo populations should be the topic of further research to reduce occurrence of MWS.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A randomised study was designed to evaluate the potential cosmetic benefit of a biomimetic, niacinamide-containing moisturising cream in oily, blemish-prone skin. METHODS: Healthy adult women with oily, blemish-prone skin were randomised to one of three treatment groups: test, control, or positive control. In the test group, subjects used the test product (containing 4\% niacinamide), plus the standard cleanser (Simple® Kind to Skin Moisturizing Facial Wash). In the control group, subjects received no moisturiser but used the standard cleanser. In the positive control group, subjects used Vivatinell Acnecinamide® Gel Cream (containing 4\% niacinamide) as a moisturiser and Neutrogena Visibly Clear® Spot Clearing Facial Wash (containing 2\% salicylic acid) as a cleanser. The positive control regimen was included to provide a comparison for estimates of effect size. The primary objective was to evaluate skin moisturisation as a change from baseline in corneometer values at 8~hours for the test regimen versus the control regimen. Analysis of covariance was applied for the primary efficacy analysis. RESULTS: A total of 132 subjects were randomised with 44 included in each treatment group. A significant difference was observed in the primary endpoint for the test regimen compared with the control regimen (least squares mean difference [95\% CI]: 3.12 [0.68, 5.56], p=0.0128). A trend was observed in favour of the positive control regimen compared with the control regimen. Secondary measurements of moisturisation supported the primary efficacy outcome. Assessment of blemishes showed a significant difference between the test regimen versus the control regimen for change from baseline in mean total blemish count at Week 8 (least squares mean difference [95\% CI]: -1.80 [-3.41, -0.19], p=0.0290). No statistical comparisons between the positive control group and the test group were performed. CONCLUSION: This study provides proof-of-concept evidence that a novel lamellar lipid moisturiser containing niacinamide, in combination with a standard cleanser, can help moisturise the skin and provide an overall improvement in the complexion appearance of people with blemish-prone skin.

  abstract = {Dog bites are a public health concern that also implicates animal welfare, with negative outcomes such as rehoming or euthanasia for the animals responsible. Previous research has shown that the severity of dog-bite injuries reflects multiple factors, including the degree of inhibition exhibited by dogs and how people behave towards dogs. This study utilizes an objective dog bite injury assessment tool: The Dunbar aggression scale. Trained officers employed by The City of Calgary systematically use the Dunbar scale whenever investigating dog-bite complaints. We analyzed The City of Calgary\&rsquo;s administrative data on confirmed dog-bite injuries in people, 2012\&ndash;2017, with a multivariable generalized ordered logistic regression model. Severe dog-bite injuries occurred more frequently in the family home than in any other setting. Young children, youths and older adults were at higher risk of more serious bites than adults. There has been a decreasing trend in the probability of a high or medium severity bite, and an increasing trend in the probability of a low severity bite since 2012. These results indicate that greater public awareness regarding dog-bite injuries is needed. Consideration should be given to campaigns targeted towards different demographics, including older adults, to provide an understanding of dog behaviour and to emphasize the need to supervise children closely in the presence of all dogs at all times, including family dogs in the home environment. Given that dog-bite injuries are not just a public health issue, but also an animal welfare issue, we endorse One Health responses in educational campaigns, policy development, and professional practice.},

The choice of breeds for such studies should be informed by a knowledge of factors such as inbreeding, genetic diversity, and population structure, which are likely to depend on breed-specific selective breeding patterns. To address the lack of such studies we have exploited one of the world's most extensive resources for canine population-genetics studies: the United Kingdom (UK) Kennel Club registration database. We chose 10 representative breeds and analyzed their pedigrees since electronic records were established around 1970, corresponding to about eight generations before present. We find extremely inbred dogs in each breed except the greyhound and estimate an inbreeding effective population size between 40 and 80 for all but 2 breeds. For all but 3 breeds, {$>$}90\% of unique genetic variants are lost over six generations, indicating a dramatic effect of breeding patterns on genetic diversity. We introduce a novel index Psi for measuring population structure directly from the pedigree and use it to identify subpopulations in several breeds. As well as informing the design of canine population genetics studies, our results have implications for breeding practices to enhance canine welfare.},

  abstract = {Bilingual speakers frequently report experiencing greater emotional resonance in their first language compared to their second. In Experiment 1, Turkish university students who had learned English as a foreign language had reduced skin conductance responses (SCRs) when listening to emotional phrases in English compared to Turkish, an effect which was most pronounced for childhood reprimands. A second type of emotional language, reading out loud true and false statements, was studied in Experiment 2. Larger SCRs were elicited by lies compared to true statements, and larger SCRs were evoked by English statements compared to Turkish statements. In contrast, ratings of how strongly participants felt they were lying showed that Turkish lies were more strongly felt than English lies. Results suggest that two factors influence the electrodermal activity elicited when bilingual speakers lie in their two languages: arousal due to emotions associated with lying, and arousal due to anxiety about managing speech production in non-native language. Anxiety and emotionality when speaking a non-naive language need to be better understood to inform practices ranging from bilingual psychotherapy to police interrogation of suspects and witnesses. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Understanding why some species are at high risk of extinction, while others remain relatively safe, is central to the development of a predictive conservation science. Recent studies have shown that a species' extinction risk may be determined by two types of factors: intrinsic biological traits and exposure to external anthropogenic threats. However, little is known about the relative and interacting effects of intrinsic and external variables on extinction risk. Using phylogenetic comparative methods, we show that extinction risk in the mammal order Carnivora is predicted more strongly by biology than exposure to high-density human populations. However, biology interacts with human population density to determine extinction risk: biological traits explain 80\% of variation in risk for carnivore species with high levels of exposure to human populations, compared to 45\% for carnivores generally. The results suggest that biology will become a more critical determinant of risk as human populations expand. We demonstrate how a model predicting extinction risk from biology can be combined with projected human population density to identify species likely to move most rapidly towards extinction by the year 2030. African viverrid species are particularly likely to become threatened, even though most are currently considered relatively safe. We suggest that a preemptive approach to species conservation is needed to identify and protect species that may not be threatened at present but may become so in the near future.},

  abstract = {The study of animal personality has attracted considerable attention, as it has revealed a number of similarities in personality between humans and several nonhuman species. At the same time the adaptive value and evolutionary maintenance of different personalities are the subject of debate. Since Pavlov’s work on dogs, students of comparative cognition have been aware that animals display vast individual differences on cognitive tasks, and that these differences may not be entirely accounted for differences in cognitive abilities. Here, we argue that personality is an important source of variation that may affect cognitive performance and we hypothesise mutual influences between personality and cognition across an individual’s lifespan. In particular, we suggest that: 1) personality profiles may be markers of different cognitive styles; 2) success or failure in cognitive tasks could affect different personalities differently; 3) ontogenetic changes of personality profiles could be reflected in changes in cognitive performance. The study of such interplay has implications in animal welfare as well as in neuroscience and in translational medicine},

But how often, and under what circumstances, does this happen? In 109 published cases involving 67 species across North America and Europe, higher density sites displayed greater recruitment per capita and per unit of land area in 72\% and 85\% of cases, respectively. The frequency of negative relationships between abundance and reproductive success did not differ between different kinds of birds or habitats. However, density was negatively related to reproductive success more often in areas of human disturbance than in relatively natural areas. Although further study is needed to confirm the generality of this pattern, especially in areas such as the tropics, results suggest that birds can fail to recognize ecological traps or opportunities in landscapes that differ from those in which they evolved.},

  abstract = {Although there have been few demonstrations of a direct empirical relationship between environmental enrichment and reproductive success in captive animals, indirect and anecdotal evidence indicates the importance of physical and temporal complexity for reproduction. We discuss three major mechanisms through which environmental enrichment that specifically increases the complexity of an animal's surroundings may influence reproductive physiology and behavior: developmental processes, modulation of stress and arousal, and modification of social interactions. In complex environments developing animals learn that performing active behavior produces appropriate functional outcomes. Learning to control their environment influences their ability to adapt to novel situations, which may profoundly influence their reproductive behavior as adults in breeding situations. Chronic stress may compromise reproductive physiology and behavior; enrichment reduces stress by providing increased opportunity for behavioral coping responses. However, some degree of acute stress may be beneficial for reproduction by maintaining an animal's level of responsiveness to socio-sexual stimuli necessary for sexual arousal and reproductive activation. Finally, environmental enrichment may influence reproductive success by stabilizing social groups, reducing aggression and increasing affiliative and play behaviors. It is concluded that multi-variate multi-institutional behavioral research in zoos will play an increasingly important role in the successful captive propagation of many species by closely examining relationships between environmental variables and reproductive potential of individual animals.},

After outlining the rationale for applying behavior to conservation, and the links that were originally proposed between them, I argue that theoretical advances in our understanding of behavior have made little practical contribution to conserving animal populations over the past decade. More optimistically, descriptive behavioral information has sometimes augmented solutions to specific conservation problems. I suggest several ways in which behavioral studies and researchers themselves could be more useful for conservation. Such changes will be necessary if the contribution of behavior to conservation is to move from intellectual wishful thinking to practical solutions for reversing the decline of small populations.},

  abstract = {Tail biting in pigs has been recognised as a welfare problem for several decades, being referred to in scientific literature as far back as the 1940s. Today, animal welfare scientists have a solid understanding of the aetiology of tail biting. Despite this, there has been a major failure in applying research findings on commercial farms. Consequently, tail biting remains a significant problem in modern intensive pig farming. Of all farming industry stakeholders, farmers have the greatest influence over the welfare of their animals. Despite this, little animal welfare research has focused on changing farmer behaviour. Understanding the reasons why farmers act or fail to act to improve animal welfare is key if research findings are to be translated into practical on-farm change. Adopting the principles of behavioural science, this review discussed theory-based methods of identifying barriers to effective tail biting management. A guide was provided for designing behaviour change interventions for farmers using The Behaviour Change Wheel, a systematic framework that links the source of behaviour to suitable interventions. It was concluded that the social sciences are of great importance to ensuring that theory is put into practice.},

Despite recent interest in the study of animal personalities within behavioural ecology, the field is fraught with conceptual and methodological difficulties inherent in any young discipline. We review the current agreement of definitions and methods used in personality studies across taxa and systems, and find that current methods risk misclassifying traits. Fortunately, these problems have been faced before by other similar fields during their infancy, affording important opportunities to learn from past mistakes. We review the tools that were developed to overcome similar methodological problems in psychology. These tools emphasise the importance of attempting to measure animal personality traits using multiple tests and the care that needs to be taken when interpreting correlations between personality traits or their tests. Accordingly, we suggest an integrative theoretical framework that incorporates these tools to facilitate a robust and unified approach in the study of animal personality.},

  abstract = {Climate change is arguably the greatest challenge to conservation of our time. Most vulnerability assessments rely on past and current species distributions to predict future persistence but ignore species' abilities to disperse through landscapes, which may be particularly important in fragmented habitats and crucial for long-term persistence in changing environments. Landscape genetic approaches explore the interactions between landscape features and gene flow and can clarify how organisms move among suitable habitats, but have suffered from methodological uncertainties. We used a landscape genetic approach to determine how landscape and climate-related features influence gene flow for American pikas (Ochotona princeps) in Crater Lake National Park. Pikas are heat intolerant and restricted to cool microclimates; thus, range contractions have been predicted as climate changes. We evaluated the correlation between landscape variables and genetic distance using partial Mantel tests in a causal modelling framework, and used spatially explicit simulations to evaluate methods of model optimization including a novel approach based on relative support and reciprocal causal modelling. We found that gene flow was primarily restricted by topographic relief, water and west-facing aspects, suggesting that physical restrictions related to small body size and mode of locomotion, as well as exposure to relatively high temperatures, limit pika dispersal in this alpine habitat. Our model optimization successfully identified landscape features influencing resistance in the simulated data for this landscape, but underestimated the magnitude of resistance. This is the first landscape genetic study to address the fundamental question of what limits dispersal and gene flow in the American pika.},

The present case illustrates the utility of a process approach to assessing cognitive deficits following VM-PFD. At age 26, C.D. acquired bilateral VM-PFD, more so in the left frontal region, following a penetrating head injury. Despite exemplary premorbid academic and military performances, his subsequent history suggests dramatic occupational and social changes, reminiscent of Phineas Gage. In fact, lesion analysis revealed similar structural damage to that estimated of Gage. C.D.'s scores on the vast majority of neuropsychological measures were average to superior (e.g., Verbal IQ = 119). However, on several new process measures, particularly those that quantify error rates on multilevel executive function and memory tasks, C.D. exhibited marked impairments. From his pattern of deficits, C.D. appeared to sacrifice accuracy for speed and to adopt liberal response strategies, implicating problems with cognitive inflexibility, impulsivity, and disinhibition. The current findings suggest that VM-PFD may be associated with a wider spectrum of cognitive deficits than previously characterized.},

  abstract = {Most of the eleven papers in this collection were delivered at the Popper Centenary conference in New Zealand in July 2002, in the city were Popper wrote The Open Society and its Enemies sixty years ago. Some of the contributors were fresh (actually a little jet-lagged) from the Vienna Conference a few days before. Alan Musgrave describes how Popper (might have) solved the problem of induction, though what he actually achieved was not a solution but an explanation that the problem is rather like the problem of building a perpetual motion machine, insoluble and not a barrier to progress. Semiha Akini explained how Popper's conventionalism is different from that of Duhem and Pioncare because it points to the indispensable role of conventions in the methods of science and it does not underwrite decisions about the content or truth of theories. A reference to Jarvie's latest book on the role of conventions or rules of the game of science would have supported this case. Phillip Catton undertook some really interesting and fine grained criticism of Popper's "conjecture and refutation" methodology with reference to Harvey's work on the role of the heart, Wegener on Continental Drift, Newton and the Einstein's early work. The gist of his argument is that these developments were "rational in ways that Popper ill equips us to fathom". I suspect that this criticism may not be as telling as he believes, for example finding out that Newton was a fallibilist hardly unsettles Popper's theory of conjectural knowledge, though it may correct some ideas that Popper and others had about Newton. Wenceslao J Gonzalez discussed the many faces of Popper's methodological approach to prediction, with some reference to economics. Unfortunately there is no mention of the large body of work in this field by Larry Boland is not mentioned here although he is the outstanding Popperian contributor to the philosophy and methodology of economics. Jeremy Shearmur provided a challenge to the bulk of the philosophical profession to see if they might have something to learn from Popper, at least from his habit of addressing problems that have both intellectual and practical import, and writing in language that is accessible to interested members of the public. It seems that Popper has practically ceased to register among both Continental and analytical philosophers, on which topic see some evidence presented below by Jeremy Waldron. Peter Munz was also entertaining and especially challenging with his thesis that Popper and Wittgenstein should have gone into partnership to provide elements that are missing from each other's schemes. Alan Ryan is a veteran commentator on these issues and he addressed the relationship between science and politics with three questions in mind. One, is democracy good for science? Two, can or should scientists seek consensus in their own fields in the same way that citizens seek consensus on public policy? Three, is science good for democracy? It seems that democracy is good for science. On the matter of scientific rationality as a model for rationality in the political domain, the answer is a muted yes, with some help from Dewey and a cryptic reference to Habermas. On the benefits of science for democracy, Ryan is not encouraging, noting the way that Big Science has generated demands for big money and that is the root of a great deal of political evil. Anthony O'Hear contributed an interesting and challenging criticism of the notion of the open society as a utopia. His main criticism is that social institutions are not just problem-solving instruments that can be designed by social engineers and put in place on order (football clubs to solve the problem of people who want to play football), they function in many ways that give meaning and purpose to people's lives. This is a fascinating paper although I think if the open society is regarded as an ideal type (in contrast with an equally idealised closed society) rather than a utopian aim, then we can get the benefit of Popper's ideas without collapsing into that form of constructivist rationalism that Hayek has identified as the great and destructive superstition of modern times. Jeremy Waldron writes on tribalism and the myth of the framework with special attention to the politics of cultural recognition. This is an intricate defence of the idea of expanding the scope of critical rationalism to address problems of culture clash in multicultural and multiracial societies. One of his targets, following Popper, is the idea that people need to share a whole framework of beliefs before they can get on together or discuss anything usefully. The example of trade would appear to be a major counter-example, where goods can be traded across all manner of social divisions just provided that both parties want to do business. I think there is a rather significant lesson to be learned there.},

In this paper, I examine the benefits of using animal models to study how personality or stable individual differences (in behavior and physiology) influence disease susceptibility and resilience. Such an expansion of animal model use, to study the relationships among personality, physiology, and health, provides a unique complement to human studies. Human studies are necessarily correlational and involve minimally-invasive physiological measures, whereas animal studies can involve experimental manipulations of potentially causal variables. For example, with animal models, genetic and environmental precursors of personality can be manipulated to test how behavioral response biases affect health, and physiological parameters can be manipulated to observe resulting changes in behavioral traits and health. In addition to these experimental benefits, lifespan longitudinal studies can be conducted with short-lived animal models to address cumulative, potentially subtle effects of personality on health. In general, animal models allow for greater in-depth analyses of physiological processes underlying relationships between personality and health, and a means for determining causal mechanisms.},

With the rise of big data and data science it has become increasingly clear that students both want, expect, and need explicit training in this area of the discipline. Additionally, recent curricular guidelines clearly state that working with data requires extensive computing skills and that statistics students should be fluent in accessing, manipulating, analyzing, and modeling with professional statistical analysis software. Much has been written in the statistics education literature about pedagogical tools and approaches to provide a practical computational foundation for students.

  abstract = {Threatened species become increasingly difficult to detect as their populations decline. Managers of such cryptic threatened species face several dilemmas: if they are not sure the species is present, should they continue to manage for that species or invest the limited resources in surveying? We find optimal solutions to this problem using a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process and rules of thumb derived from an analytical approximation. We discover that managing a protected area for a cryptic threatened species can be optimal even if we are not sure the species is present. The more threatened and valuable the species is, relative to the costs of management, the more likely we are to manage this species without determining its continued persistence by using surveys. If a species remains unseen, our belief in the persistence of the species declines to a point where the optimal strategy is to shift resources from saving the species to surveying for it. Finally, when surveys lead to a sufficiently low belief that the species is extant, we surrender resources to other conservation actions. We illustrate our findings with a case study using parameters based on the critically endangered Sumatran tiger (Panthera tigris sumatrae), and we generate rules of thumb on how to allocate conservation effort for any cryptic species. Using Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes in conservation science, we determine the conditions under which it is better to abandon management for that species because our belief that it continues to exist is too low.},

We subsequently obtained an entire adult male specimen and tissue remains from two other M. munzala individuals. Molecular analyses establish the distinct identity of the species and indicate a time of origin of c. 0.48 mya for it. The species also shows close phylogenetic affinities with the allopatric M. radiata and with the geographically closer M. assamensis and M. thibetana, possibly mediated by male introgression from an ancestral M. assamensis-M. thibetana stock into an ancestral M. munzala stock. Morphometric analyses, on the other hand, reiterate its close similarity only with M. assamensis and M. thibetana, presumably resulting from convergent evolution under similar ecological conditions and along a latitudinal gradient, as predicted by Bergmann's and Allen's rules.},

The aim of the investigation was to assess behavior in order to suggest ways of improving captive care and management of the species. This was undertaken by constructing time-budgets and activity patterns and identifying any abnormal repetitive behavior (ARB) exhibited. Scan and focal animal sampling were implemented in observations of seven subjects. Analyses detailed idiosyncrasies in how subjects partitioned their active time. Peak activity occurred between 18:00 and 21:00\,hr. Two ARBs, clawing and pacing, were identified and the cessation of clawing in one subject was possible by modifying its enclosure. Stress-related behavior, understood to be related to several factors, means maintaining this species in captivity remains problematic. Recommendations are made pertaining to husbandry, captive management, and future research. Zoo Biol 29:1-13, 2011. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {The graphing capabilities of R are virtually unlimited (see http://addictedtor.free.fr/graphiques/ for some examples). In this section we will examine several different types of graphs that I regularly use in my own research. We will also introduce an additional graph-ing package (e.g., ggplot2) that can add even greater flexibility to the graphing options in R . 1 Plotting Mixed Models 1.1 Plotting Linear Mixed Models Often when graphically depicting the results of a linear mixed model we are interested in seeing (1) the raw data, (2) individual regression lines (i.e., the random effects), and (3) the group regression line (i.e., the fixed effect factor parameter estimates). This type of graph can be a nightmare to create in other programs such as SPSS or even excel. However, it can be created with relative ease using the basic R graphing tools. For this example we will return to the decision conflict example from the Ultimatum Game dataset that we previously discussed in the mixed model section. We will use the basic varying intercept and varying slope Offer amount regression on RT. Here we will rerun the same model (model 3 from the other section) and will extract both the fixed effect parameters using the fixef() command and the random effects coefficients using the ranef() command. As we discussed earlier in the mixed model section, the random coefficients are random deviations centered around the fixed effects, so we must add the fixed effects to the random effects for plotting purposes. This is accomplished by selecting the columns for the intercept and slope from ranParam and adding them to the corresponding columns of the 1},

The principal effectors of the stress system include corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH); arginine vasopressin; the proopiomelanocortin-derived peptides α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone and β-endorphin, the glucocorticoids; and the catecholamines norepinephrine and epinephrine. Appropriate responsiveness of the stress system to stressors is a crucial prerequisite for a sense of well-being, adequate performance of tasks, and positive social interactions. By contrast, inappropriate responsiveness of the stress system may impair growth and development and may account for a number of endocrine, metabolic, autoimmune, and psychiatric disorders. The development and severity of these conditions primarily depend on the genetic vulnerability of the individual, the exposure to adverse environmental factors, and the timing of the stressful events, given that prenatal life, infanc...},

This has been suggested to be the consequence of a demographic bottleneck 10\hspace{1em}000-12\hspace{1em}000\hspace{1em}years ago (ya) and also led to the assumption that only small genetic differences exist between the described subspecies. However, analysing mitochondrial DNA and microsatellites in cheetah samples from most of the historic range of the species we found relatively deep phylogeographic breaks between some of the investigated populations, and most of the methods assessed divergence time estimates predating the postulated bottleneck. Mitochondrial DNA monophyly and overall levels of genetic differentiation support the distinctiveness of Northern-East African cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus soemmeringii). Moreover, combining archaeozoological and contemporary samples, we show that Asiatic cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus venaticus) are unambiguously separated from African subspecies. Divergence time estimates from mitochondrial and nuclear data place the split between Asiatic and Southern African cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus jubatus) at 32\hspace{1em}000-67\hspace{1em}000\hspace{1em}ya using an average mammalian microsatellite mutation rate and at 4700-44\hspace{1em}000\hspace{1em}ya employing human microsatellite mutation rates. Cheetahs are vulnerable to extinction globally and critically endangered in their Asiatic range, where the last 70-110 individuals survive only in Iran. We demonstrate that these extant Iranian cheetahs are an autochthonous monophyletic population and the last representatives of the Asiatic subspecies A.\hspace{1em}j.\hspace{1em}venaticus. We advocate that conservation strategies should consider the uncovered independent evolutionary histories of Asiatic and African cheetahs, as well as among some African subspecies.

The first section will show how the neuroendocrinology of chronic stress is characterised by an up-regulation of the central drive to the HPA axis in conjunction with down-regulation of its negative feedback control. The second will show that very similar processes occur in depressive illness. The third section will describe social, developmental and genetic influences on the HPA axis both in experimental animals and in man. The fourth will show how activation of the HPA axis can influence the development of animal models of depression as well as the onset and perpetuation of clinical depression. The final section will draw together an overall hypothesis and indicate the potential for new treatments for depression that arise from this work.},

  abstract = {Observers of deviant social behavior sometimes communicate disapproval directly or indirectly to the perpetrator of a deviant act. This reaction has been termed `social control'. Three field studies were conducted to explore the influence of the number of bystander-observers on the likelihood of social control. We predicted that the presence of others would inhibit people's tendency to communicate their disapproval to the deviant but only if personal implication was low. In the first study, we measured participants' perceptions of two fictive situations, one in which a deviant draws graffiti in an elevator of a shopping center and one in which a deviant litters in a small neighborhood park by throwing a plastic bottle in the bushes. As expected, participants considered both behaviors to be equally counternormative but felt personally more implicated by the littering behavior in the park. In Studies 2 and 3, the two situations were enacted with confederates of the experimenter Naive bystanders served as participants, and social control was the primary dependent variable. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found evidence for a bystander effect in the low personal implication situation ('graffiti in the elevator') but not in the high personal implication situation ('littering in park').

  abstract = {Observers of deviant social behavior sometimes communicate disapproval directly or indirectly to the perpetrator of a deviant act. This reaction has been termed lsquosocial controlrsquo. Three field studies were conducted to explore the influence of the number of bystander-observers on the likelihood of social control. We predicted that the presence of others would inhibit people's tendency to communicate their disapproval to the deviant but only if personal implication was low. In the first study, we measured participants' perceptions of two fictive situations, one in which a deviant draws graffiti in an elevator of a shopping center and one in which a deviant litters in a small neighborhood park by throwing a plastic bottle in the bushes. As expected, participants considered both behaviors to be equally counternormative but felt personally more implicated by the littering behavior in the park. In Studies 2 and 3, the two situations were enacted with confederates of the experimenter. Naïve bystanders served as participants, and social control was the primary dependent variable. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found evidence for a bystander effect in the low personal implication situation (lsquograffiti in the elevatorrsquo) but not in the high personal implication situation (lsquolittering in parkrsquo). These results make clear that perceived personal implication moderates the extent to which people are inhibited by the presence of others when they decide whether they should exert social control or not.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND\textbackslash nMost cases of hepatocellular carcinoma occur in the Asia-Pacific region, where chronic hepatitis B infection is an important aetiological factor. Assessing the efficacy and safety of new therapeutic options in an Asia-Pacific population is thus important. We did a multinational phase III, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of sorafenib in patients from the Asia-Pacific region with advanced (unresectable or metastatic) hepatocellular carcinoma. \textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODS\textbackslash nBetween Sept 20, 2005, and Jan 31, 2007, patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who had not received previous systemic therapy and had Child-Pugh liver function class A, were randomly assigned to receive either oral sorafenib (400 mg) or placebo twice daily in 6-week cycles, with efficacy measured at the end of each 6-week period. Eligible patients were stratified by the presence or absence of macroscopic vascular invasion or extrahepatic spread (or both), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, and geographical region. Randomisation was done centrally and in a 2:1 ratio by means of an interactive voice-response system. There was no predefined primary endpoint; overall survival, time to progression (TTP), time to symptomatic progression (TTSP), disease control rate (DCR), and safety were assessed. Efficacy analyses were done by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00492752. \textbackslash n\textbackslash nFINDINGS\textbackslash n271 patients from 23 centres in China, South Korea, and Taiwan were enrolled in the study. Of these, 226 patients were randomly assigned to the experimental group (n=150) or to the placebo group (n=76). Median overall survival was 6·5 months (95\% CI 5·56–7·56) in patients treated with sorafenib, compared with 4·2 months (3·75–5·46) in those who received placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0·68 [95\% CI 0·50–0·93]; p=0·014). Median TTP was 2·8 months (2·63–3·58) in the sorafenib group compared with 1·4 months (1·35–1·55) in the placebo group (HR 0·57 [0·42–0·79]; p=0·0005). The most frequently reported grade 3/4 drug-related adverse events in the 149 assessable patients treated with sorafenib were hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR; 16 patients [10·7\%]), diarrhoea (nine patients [6·0\%]), and fatigue (five patients [3·4\%]). The most common adverse events resulting in dose reductions were HFSR (17 patients [11·4\%]) and diarrhoea (11 patients [7·4\%]); these adverse events rarely led to discontinuation. \textbackslash n\textbackslash nINTERPRETATION\textbackslash nSorafenib is effective for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma in patients from the Asia-Pacific region, and is well tolerated. Taken together with data from the Sorafenib Hepatocellular Carcinoma Assessment Randomised Protocol (SHARP) trial, sorafenib seems to be an appropriate option for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. \textbackslash n\textbackslash nFUNDING\textbackslash nBayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals and Onyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc.},

Issuer characteristics do not explain the results: holding fixed the issuer, funds with higher Eurozone exposure cut lending more. Due to credit market frictions, funds with low Eurozone exposure provided substitute financing only to issuers they had pre-existing relationships with, even though issuers are large, highly rated firms.},

However, more recently, it has become clear that tradeoffs exist between decision speed and accuracy in many ecologically relevant tasks, for example, prey and predator detection and identification; pollinators choosing between flower species; and spatial exploration strategies. Obtaining high-quality information often increases sampling time, especially under noisy conditions. Here we discuss the mechanisms generating such speed-accuracy tradeoffs, their implications for animal decision making (including signalling, communication and mate choice) and the significance of differences in decision strategies among species, populations and individuals. The ecological relevance of such tradeoffs can be better understood by considering the neuronal mechanisms underlying decision-making processes.},

The bulk of the significant age-specific associations occurred in those whose age of onset was under 16. These associations were concentrated in those subjects who at some time took an illicit drug. These results are consistent with studies which associate greater rates of alcohol dependence among those who begin drinking at an early age. The age specificity of the genetic and neurophysiological factors is consistent with recent studies of adolescent brain development, which locate an interval of heightened vulnerability to substance use disorders in the early to mid teens.},

  abstract = {Solutions are needed to keep pigs under commercial conditions without tail biting outbreaks (TBOs). However, as TBOs are inevitable, even in well managed farms, it is crucial to know how to manage TBOs when they occur. We evaluated the effectiveness of multi-step intervention protocols to control TBOs. Across 96 pens (1248 undocked pigs) managed on fully-slatted floors, 40 TBOs were recorded (\&ge;3 out of 12\&ndash;14 pigs with fresh tail wounds). When an outbreak was identified, either the biters or the victims were removed, or enrichment (three ropes) was added. If the intervention failed, another intervention was randomly used until all three interventions had been deployed once. Fifty percent of TBOs were controlled after one intervention, 30\% after 2\&ndash;3 interventions, and 20\% remained uncontrolled. A high proportion of biters/victims per pen reduced intervention success more so than the type of intervention. When only one intervention was used, adding ropes was the fastest method to overcome TBOs. Removed biters and victims were successfully reintroduced within 14 days back to their home pens. In conclusion, 80\% of TBOs were successfully controlled within 18.4 \&plusmn; 1.7 days on average using one or multiple cost-effective intervention strategies.},

  abstract = {India harbours the largest wild tiger population in the world and Tropical Dry Forest areas constitute the largest habitat for them. Recent extinctions, however, from two high profile tiger reserves, highlight the vulnerability of tiger in this habitat. Our examination of historic range areas for tigers shows that populations are disappearing at a faster rate in Tropical Dry Forest (64\% sites suffering local extinction in 100 years) than in any other suitable habitat in India. Focusing on data from the Tropical Dry Forest of Panna Tiger Reserve in central India, we examine the spatial ecology of the tiger population prior to its local extinction. We analyse home range sizes, overlaps and shifts, as well as the range expansion and contraction of radio-collared tigers between 1996 and 2005. In this reserve, the average annual home range sizes for both males (n = 2) and females (n = 4) were three to four times larger than those reported so far from other tropical habitats in India - male: mean 179.3 ± 11.8 km2 (95\% Fixed kernel; n = 7); female: mean 46.6 ± 3.7 km2; (95\% Fixed kernel; n = 16). Adult female home ranges were exclusive and overlapped little with neighbouring female ranges (3 ± 1.46\%, n = 6). Male home ranges were not exclusive: resident floater males shared space with territorial males and mated with resident females. Home ranges of all breeding radio-collared tigers extended beyond the protected area boundary and were exposed to edge effects that exist at the periphery and outside. With such spatial use patterns, security and management measures provided within the boundary are unlikely to be very successful in protecting the population. Protected Areas in Tropical Dry Forest across India are relatively small (366.92 ± 422.12 km2 SD) and historical trends point towards a scale-mismatch that exists between the size of Protected Areas and the space use requirements of tigers. This scale mismatch adds to the vulnerability of existing small populations and perhaps explains why tiger populations in Tropical Dry Forest have disappeared at a faster rate than in any other tiger habitat of the sub-continent.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of animals' hormonal status is important for conservation studies in wild or semi-free-ranging conditions as well as for behavioural and clinical experiments conducted in laboratory research, mostly performed on rats and mice. Faecal sampling is a useful non-invasive method to obtain steroid hormone assessments. Nevertheless, in laboratory studies, unlike other contexts, faecal sampling is less utilised. One of the issues raised is the necessity to collect samples belonging to different animals, separately. Usually, researchers using faecal sampling solve this problem through the isolation of animals or taking the cage rather than single animal as unit of study. These solutions though, could lead to unreliable measurements, and cannot be applied in many studies. Our aim was to show the biological reliability of individual faecal corticosterone metabolite (FCM) assessments in socially housed male and female Wistar rats. We analytically validated the enzyme immunoassay kit used for FCM assessments. Then, we exposed the animals to two different stress stimuli that are known to activate the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis and the following release of corticosterone to biologically validate the EIA kit: environmental enrichment and predator odour. Individual faecal sampling from social animals was collected through short-time handling. The results demonstrated that both the stimuli increased FCM levels in male and female rats showing the reliability of EIA kit assessment and the applicability of our sampling method. We also found a diurnal rhythm in FCM levels. These results could help to increase the use of faecal hormone metabolite determinations in studies conducted on rats.},

  abstract = {Environmental enrichment (EE) is an integral aspect of modern zoo animal management but, empirical evaluation of it is biased toward species housed in single-species groups. Nocturnal houses, where several nocturnal species are housed together, are particularly overlooked. This study investigated whether three species (nine-banded armadillos, Dasypus novemcinctus; Senegal bush babies, Galago senegalensis; two-toed sloths, Choloepus didactylus) in the nocturnal house at Paignton Zoo Environmental Park, UK could be enriched using food-based and sensory EE. Subjects were an adult male and female of each species. EE was deemed effective if it promoted target species-typical behaviors, behavioral diversity, and increased use of enriched exhibit zones. Results from generalized linear mixed models demonstrated that food-based EE elicited the most positive behavioral effects across species. One set of food-based EEs (Kong®, termite mound and hanging food) presented together was associated with a significant increase in species-typical behaviors, increased behavioral diversity, and increased use of enriched exhibit zones in armadillos and bush babies. Although one type of sensory EE (scented pine cones) increased overall exhibit use in all species, the other (rainforest sounds) was linked to a significant decrease in species-typical behavior in bush babies and sloths. There were no intra or interspecies conflicts over EE, and commensalism occurred between armadillos and bush babies. Our data demonstrate that simple food-based and sensory EE can promote positive behavioral changes in a mixed-species nocturnal mammal exhibit. We suggest that both food and sensory EE presented concurrently will maximize opportunities for naturalistic activity in all species.},

  abstract = {The wildlife trade poses substantial threats to global biodiversity. China is a significant source of threatened species and also a market for wildlife products. Zoological parks (zoos), which are a popular leisure attraction in China as elsewhere, are increasingly conceptualized as places to educate visitors about both animals and environmental threats more generally. This paper reports on an attempt to inform Chinese zoo visitors about the threats presented by the wildlife trade, and about the opportunity to take personal actions to help protect wildlife. Results from a baseline survey of attitudes among 524 adult visitors to animal exhibits in Chengdu, China showed a high degree of concern about wildlife paired with a lack of confidence about what could be done. A sense of connection to nature, along with a perception of personal efficacy, were the strongest predictors of concern about the wildlife trade. Based in part on these results, an informational exhibit was designed and implemented in two locations in Chengdu. A survey of 533 visitors to assess the impact of the new exhibit showed that connection and perceived efficacy continued to predict concern, and that talking about the exhibit was associated with increased knowledge and concern. Though causality cannot be definitively concluded, results suggest that zoos have the potential to influence attitudes and perceived norms regarding the wildlife trade. By affirming the importance of a feeling of connection, the findings indicate that animal facilities may have an important role in fostering the human relationship to the natural world.},

  abstract = {Cognitive bias testing measures how emotional states can affect cognitive processes, often described using the “glass half-full/half-empty” paradigm. Classical or operant conditioning is used to measure responses to ambiguous cues, and it has been reported across many species and contexts that an animal’s cognitive bias can be directly linked to welfare state, e.g., those in better welfare make more optimistic judgements. Cognitive bias testing has only recently been applied to animals and represents a key milestone in welfare science: it is currently one of the only accurate methods available to measure welfare. The tests have been conducted on many farm, laboratory, and companion animal species, but have only been carried out in zoo settings a handful of times. The aims of this review are to evaluate the feasibility of cognitive bias testing in zoos and its potential as a tool for studying zoo animal welfare. The few existing zoo cognitive bias studies are reviewed, as well as those conducted on similar, non-domesticated species. This work is then used to discuss how tests could be successfully designed and executed in zoo settings, which types of tests are most appropriate in different contexts, and how the data could be used to improve animal welfare. The review closely examines the many variables are present in the zoo which cannot be controlled as in other settings, termed here the Zoo Environment (ZE) Variables. It is recommended that tests are developed after consideration of each of the ZE Variables, and through strong collaboration between zookeepers, managers, and academic institutions. There is much unexplored potential of cognitive bias testing in the zoo setting, not least its use in investigating animal welfare in zoos. It is hoped that this review will stimulate increased interest in this topic from zoo managers, scientists, and industry regulators alike.},

  abstract = {Many animals display a suite of increased vigilance and/or activity responses in relation to upcoming events, termed “anticipatory behavior.” Anticipatory behavior toward positive events has been suggested as a cross-species measure of affective state as it likely reflects the balance of the reward-sensitivity system: various studies suggest that animals in poorer welfare situations show higher or excessive levels of anticipation for positive events. Another tool for evaluating animals' affective state is cognitive bias testing, and although it has been attempted, a link has not yet been made between cognitive bias and anticipatory behavior levels. Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in captivity increase the performance of behaviors such as surface-looking and spy-hopping in anticipation of training sessions during which food is provided. In this study we measured anticipatory behavior frequency in bottlenose dolphins prior to positive reinforcement training sessions, and assessed whether frequency of anticipatory behavior correlated with their performance on cognitive bias tasks. We found that higher frequencies of anticipatory behavior for training sessions was significantly associated with more pessimistic judgements in cognitive bias tests, supporting previous findings linking higher reward sensitivity with negative affective states. Anticipatory behavior is an easily measured activity and could represent a welfare indicator in dolphins as well as other animals in captive environments.},

Objective The objective of our study was to evaluate the brain activations associated with small animals’ phobia through the use of virtual environments. This context will have the added benefit of allowing the subject to move and interact with the environment, giving the subject the illusion of being there. Methods We have analyzed the brain activation in a group of phobic people while they navigated in a virtual environment that included the small animals that were the object of their phobia. Results We have found brain activation mainly in the left occipital inferior lobe (P{$<$}.05 corrected, cluster size=36), related to the enhanced visual attention to the phobic stimuli; and in the superior frontal gyrus (P{$<$}.005 uncorrected, cluster size=13), which is an area that has been previously related to the feeling of self-awareness. Conclusions In our opinion, these results demonstrate that virtual stimulus can enhance brain activations consistent with previous studies with still images, but in an environment closer to the real situation the subject would face in their daily lives.},

Here we investigate this previously unexplained variation in captive animals' welfare by focusing on caged carnivores, and show that it stems from constraints imposed on the natural behaviour of susceptible animals, with wide-ranging lifestyles in the wild predicting stereotypy and the extent of infant mortality in captivity. Our findings indicate that the keeping of naturally wide-ranging carnivores should be either fundamentally improved or phased out.},

  abstract = {Darwin developed the theory of sexual selection to account for the evolution of weaponry, ornamentation and other secondary sexual characters that are commonly more developed in males and which appeared unlikely to contribute to survival. He argued that these traits had evolved either through intrasexual competition between males to monopolize access to females or through consistent female preferences for mating with superior partners. Since 1871, a substantial body of research has confirmed his explanation of the evolution of secondary sexual characters in males, although sex differences in reproductive behaviour are more diverse and the evolutionary mechanisms responsible for them are more complex than was initially recognized. However, secondary sexual characters are also widespread in females but, as yet, their evolution and distribution have received relatively little attention from evolutionary biologists. Here, I suggest that the mechanisms responsible for the evolution of secondary sexual characters in females are similar to those operating in males and include intrasexual competition between females for breeding opportunities, male mating preferences and female competition to attract mates. Unlike males, females often compete more intensely for resources necessary for successful reproduction than for access to mating partners and the development of secondary sexual characters in females may be limited by costs to fecundity rather than to survival.},

  abstract = {Birds are constantly responding to stimuli from their environment. When these stimuli are perceived as threatening, stress responses are initiated, with activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis and the release of corticosterone from the adrenal gland. The basic emo-tion of fear is also experienced during a stress response. Corticosterone stress responses and behavioural responses to stimuli vary markedly between individual birds, raising questions about the significance of these individual dif-ferences and about the relationship between corticosterone responses and fearfulness in birds. Although fearfulness can be challenging to measure, data from several species indicate that corticosterone responses and fear behaviour responses are linked in individual birds. Consistent profiles of behavioural responses of birds to a wide range of stimuli can be identified and are called personalities. Personalities vary along a continuum, but are usually classified as proactive or reactive. Individual corticosterone and behaviour responses depend on each bird's personality. Birds with proactive personalities have relatively active behavioural responses and relatively low corticosterone stress responses, whilst birds with reactive personalities have relatively passive behavioural responses and large corticosterone responses. Relationships between the phys-iological and behavioural characteristics of avian person-alities can now be explored in detail to determine the significance of individual differences in stress responses and personalities in birds.},

  abstract = {Despite a growing body of evidence linking personality to life-history variation and fitness, the behavioural mechanisms underlying these relationships remain poorly understood. One mechanism thought to play a key role is how individuals respond to risk. Relatively reactive and proactive (or shy and bold) personality types are expected to differ in how they manage the inherent trade-off between productivity and survival, with bold individuals being more risk-prone with lower survival probability, and shy individuals adopting a more risk-averse strategy. In the great tit (Parus major), the shy-bold personality axis has been well characterized in captivity and linked to fitness. Here, we tested whether 'exploration behaviour', a captive assay of the shy-bold axis, can predict risk responsiveness during reproduction in wild great tits. Relatively slow-exploring (shy) females took longer than fast-exploring (bold) birds to resume incubation after a novel object, representing an unknown threat, was attached to their nest-box, with some shy individuals not returning within the 40 min trial period. Risk responsiveness was consistent within individuals over days. These findings provide rare, field-based experimental evidence that shy individuals prioritize survival over reproductive investment, supporting the hypothesis that personality reflects life-history variation through links with risk responsiveness.},

  abstract = {The serotonin transporter (SERT) terminates serotonergic signalling through the sodium- and chloride-dependent reuptake of neurotransmitter into presynaptic neurons. SERT is a target for antidepressant and psychostimulant drugs, which block reuptake and prolong neurotransmitter signalling. Here we report X-ray crystallographic structures of human SERT at 3.15 Å resolution bound to the antidepressants (S)-citalopram or paroxetine. Antidepressants lock SERT in an outward-open conformation by lodging in the central binding site, located between transmembrane helices 1, 3, 6, 8 and 10, directly blocking serotonin binding. We further identify the location of an allosteric site in the complex as residing at the periphery of the extracellular vestibule, interposed between extracellular loops 4 and 6 and transmembrane helices 1, 6, 10 and 11. Occupancy of the allosteric site sterically hinders ligand unbinding from the central site, providing an explanation for the action of (S)-citalopram as an allosteric ligand. These structures define the mechanism of antidepressant action in SERT, and provide blueprints for future drug design.},

  abstract = {The task of maintaining erect stance involves a complex sensorimotor control system, the output of which can be highly irregular. Even when a healthy individual attempts to stand still, the center of gravity of his or her body and the center of pressure (COP) under his or her feet continually move about in an erratic fashion. In this study, we approach the problem of characterizing postural sway from the perspective of random-walk theory. Specifically, we analyze COP trajectories as one-dimensional and two-dimensional random walks. These analyses reveal that over short-term intervals of time during undisturbed stance the COP behaves as a positively correlated random walk, whereas over long-term intervals of time it resembles a negatively correlated random walk. We interpret this novel finding as an indication that during quiet standing the postural control system utilizes open-loop and closed-loop control schemes over short-term and long-term intervals, respectively. From this perspective, our approach, known as stabilogram-diffusion analysis, has the advantage that it leads to the extraction of COP parameters which can be directly related to the steady-state behavior and functional interaction of the neuromuscular mechanisms underlying the maintenance of erect stance.

The purposes of this meta-analysis were to summarize evidence on (a) extent and types of change in participants in service learning programs, (b) specific program elements (moderators) that affect the amount of change in participants, and (c) generalizability of results across educational levels and curricular versus noncurricular service. We included 103 samples and found positive changes for all types of outcomes. Changes were moderate for academic outcomes, small for personal outcomes and citizenship outcomes, and in between for social outcomes. Programs with structured reflection showed larger changes and effects generalized across educational levels. We call for psychologists to increase their use of service learning, and we discuss resources for doing so.},

  abstract = {Stabled horses commonly perform stereotypic patterns of weaving, where the horse shifts its weight from side to side often swinging its head. Ten warm-blood types, of which five were known to reliably weave, were housed in similar 12x12 ft wooden loose boxes in a single stable block surrounding a courtyard. Each horse was exposed to each of five stable designs. These were: the conventional front top-half of the door open only with a view of the stable courtyard (F); front half-door open and a similar half-door open at the back of the stable with a view to the surrounding fields (FB); back open only (B); front and one-side panel open with a view into the adjacent stable (FS); and front, back and both sides open (All4). During observation days, horses were brought in from the field at 0830 h, fed concentrate at 0930 h, fed haylage at 1005 h and turned out at 1600 h. Behaviour was recorded from 0900 to 1040 h, 1200 to 1300 h and 1500 to 1600 h. Weaving was most common prior to feeding in the morning and prior to putting out to pasture in the afternoon. There was a significant effect of stable design on weaving, with less weaving in the FS and All4 designs than the F treatment. There was also a significant effect of stable design on repetitive nodding, though in this case, FB, B, FS and All4 designs each reduced nodding compared with the F treatment. The effect of stable design can be explained in a number of ways. Firstly, it could be the novelty of the environmental change, though there was no evidence in this study of an increase in stereotypy with prolonged exposure to the new stable designs. Secondly, opening windows may increase opportunities for environmental interaction, and the expression of new activities may compete with stereotypic behaviour for the horse's time. Thirdly, the open windows may allow expression of specific activities such as environmental monitoring or social interaction that are denied by the conventional stable.},

  abstract = {Over the last several decades, positive public attitudes towards animal welfare have continued to develop. Consumers\&rsquo; attitudes towards farm animal welfare indicate increasing concern about animal welfare in food production. Yet, this growing interest in the lives of farm animals does not correspond with a wholesale increase in demand for higher welfare products, providing evidence of the citizen-consumer attitude-behaviour gap (herein referred to as the attitude-behaviour gap). Minimising the attitude\&ndash;behaviour gap and supporting consumers to make higher animal welfare choices may help producers to enhance the lives of farm animals. However, despite increasing awareness in this area, solutions to resolve this gap often focus on knowledge transfer and do not appear to have had a significant impact. The aim of this article is to review current knowledge around the attitude-behaviour gap, and situate it within the context of the behaviour change wheel; exploring the capabilities, opportunities, and motivations driving, as well as the barriers inhibiting consumers from making higher welfare food choices. Using this framework, the review aims to identify interventions that may boost consumer demand for higher welfare products sold at a premium price and provide suggestions for future research. Further work to increase understanding in this area is then also suggested.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews the core findings from recently published place-based crime prevention research. It critically evaluates the available evidence on the contribution of Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) as a crime prevention strategy. CPTED is both an increasingly fashionable approach and is being implemented on a global scale (Cisneros, 1995). Additionally, individual components such as territoriality, surveillance, maintenance, access control, activity support and target-hardening are being widely deployed. However, the evidence currently available is inconclusive and much criticised, which effectively prevents widespread intervention and investment in such an approach by central government. The authors detail the difficulties associated with demonstrating the effectiveness of CPTED and conclude that although empirical proof has not been definitively demonstrated, there is a large and growing body of research, which supports the assertion that CPTED is a pragmatic and effective crime prevention tool. This review provides an extensive bibliography of contemporary CPTED and a follow-up paper will discuss the future research priorities for CPTED.},

This study demonstrates how the ability to accurately detect self-directed gaze, called the stare-in-the-crowd effect, can be studied using a new eye-tracking paradigm. A set of images was developed to test this effect using a group of healthy undergraduate students. Eye movements and pupil size were tracked while they viewed these images. Participants also completed behavioral measures about themselves. Results show that self-directed gaze results in significantly more looking by participants. Behavioral predictors of gaze behaviors were not identified, likely given the health of the sample. However, correlations with variables are reported to explore in future research.},

This study demonstrates how the ability to accurately detect self-directed gaze, called the stare-in-the-crowd effect, can be studied using a new eye-tracking paradigm. A set of images was developed to test this effect using a group of healthy undergraduate students. Eye movements and pupil size were tracked while they viewed these images. Participants also completed behavioral measures about themselves. Results show that self-directed gaze results in significantly more looking by participants. Behavioral predictors of gaze behaviors were not identified, likely given the health of the sample. However, correlations with variables are reported to explore in future research.},

  abstract = {Vocal learning, where animals can modify the structure of their vocalizations as a result of experience, has been found in a range of birds and mammals. Although vocal learning is a fundamental aspect of developing spoken language, there is as yet little evidence that vocal learning occurs in primates. Here we examine whether vocal learning may occur in chimpanzees. We analysed whether wild male chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes verus, of four communities living in a similar habitat in the Taıorest, Coe d'Ivoire, developed community specific pant hoots. If so, we expected males of three contiguous communities to have distinct pant hoots, while pant hoots of males from a fourth, distant community, located 70 km away, should only differ from those of the contiguous communities by chance. Our analysis confirmed these expectations. In addition, the acoustic distances between the pant hoots of pairs of individuals did not correlate with the genetic relatedness of those pairs, where genetic relatedness was determined using nuclear DNA analysis. Thus, neither habitat nor genetic differences accounted for the observation that there were acoustic differences in the pant hoot structure of males living in neighbouring communities, but not in those of males from a distant community. This suggests that chimpanzees may actively modify pant hoots to be different from their neighbours, providing support for the vocal learning hypothesis.},

  abstract = {Background. Studying animal cognition in a social setting is associated with practical and statistical challenges. However, conducting cognitive research without disturbing species-typical social groups can increase ecological validity, minimize distress, and improve animal welfare. Here, we review the existing literature on cognitive research run with primates in a social setting in order to determine how widespread such testing is and highlight approaches that may guide future research planning. Survey Methodology. Using Google Scholar to search the terms "primate" "cognition" "experiment" and "social group," we conducted a systematic literature search covering 16 years (2000-2015 inclusive). We then conducted two supplemental searches within each journal that contained a publication meeting our criteria in the original search, using the terms "primate" and "playback" in one search and the terms "primate" "cognition" and "social group" in the second. The results were used to assess how frequently nonhuman primate cognition has been studied in a social setting ({$>$} 3 individuals), to gain perspective on the species and topics that have been studied, and to extract successful approaches for social testing. Results. Our search revealed 248 unique publications in 43 journals encompassing 71 species. The absolute number of publications has increased over years, suggesting viable strategies for studying cognition in social settings. While a wide range of species were studied they were not equally represented, with 19\% of the publications reporting data for chimpanzees. Field sites were the most common environment for experiments run in social groups of primates, accounting for more than half of the results. Approaches to mitigating the practical and statistical challenges were identified. Discussion. This analysis has revealed that the study of primate cognition in a social setting is increasing and taking place across a range of environments. This literature review calls attention to examples that may provide valuable models for researchers wishing to overcome potential practical and statistical challenges to studying cognition in a social setting, ultimately increasing validity and improving the welfare of the primates we study.},

  abstract = {Attention bias describes the differential allocation of attention towards one stimulus compared to others. In humans, this bias can be mediated by the observer’s affective state and is implicated in the onset and maintenance of affective disorders such as anxiety. Affect-driven attention biases (ADABs) have also been identified in a few other species. Here, we review the literature on ADABs in animals and discuss their utility as welfare indicators. Despite a limited research effort, several studies have found that negative affective states modulate attention to negative (i.e., threatening) cues. ADABs influenced by positive-valence states have also been documented in animals. We discuss methods for measuring ADAB and conclude that looking time, dot-probe, and emotional spatial cueing paradigms are particularly promising. Research is needed to test them with a wider range of species, investigate attentional scope as an indicator of affect, and explore the possible causative role of attention biases in determining animal wellbeing. Finally, we argue that ADABs might not be best-utilized as indicators of general valence, but instead to reveal specific emotions, motivations, aversions, and preferences. Paying attention to the human literature could facilitate these advances.},

Combinations of warmth and competence generate distinct emotions of admiration, contempt, envy, and pity. From these intergroup emotions and stereotypes, the behavior from intergroup affect and stereotypes (BIAS) map predicts distinct behaviors: active and passive, facilitative and harmful. After defining warmth/communion and competence/agency, the chapter integrates converging work documenting the centrality of these dimensions in interpersonal as well as intergroup perception. Structural origins of warmth and competence perceptions result from competitors judged as not warm, and allies judged as warm; high status confers competence and low status incompetence. Warmth and competence judgments support systematic patterns of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral reactions, including ambivalent prejudices. Past views of prejudice as a univalent antipathy have obscured the unique responses toward groups stereotyped as competent but not warm or warm but not competent. Finally, the chapter addresses unresolved issues and future research directions. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Heat stress (HS) is a main environmental challenge affecting the animal welfare and production efficiency in pig industry. In recent years, numerous reports have studied the alterations in gene expressions and protein profiles in heat-stressed pigs. However, the use of metabolome to unravel adaptive mechanisms of finishing pig in response to chronic HS have not yet been elucidated. We aimed to investigate the effects of chronic HS on serum metabolome in finishing pigs, and to identify the biomarkers of heat stress. Pigs (n = 8 per treatment) were exposed to either thermal neutral (TN; 22 \&deg;C) or heat stress (HS, 30 \&deg;C) conditions for three weeks. Serum metabonomics of TN- and HS-treated pigs were compared using the GC-MS approach. Metabonomics analysis revealed that twenty-four metabolites had significantly different levels in TN compared to HS (variable importance in the projection values \&gt;1 and p \&lt; 0.05). These metabolites are involved in carbohydrate, amino acid, fatty acid, amines metabolism, and gut microbiome-derived metabolism. Three serum monoses (glucose, mannose 2, and galactose) and 6-phosphogluconic acid were decreased, indicating insufficient source of fuel for energy supply, resulting in negative energy balance (NEB) in heat-stressed pigs. Increased levels of non-esterified fatty acid (myristic acid, palmitic acid, and linoleic acid) and short-chain fatty acids (3-hydroxybutanoic acid and maleic acid) suggested fat decomposition compensating for energy shortage, which was an adaptive response to NEB. Increased concentrations of fluorine, lyxose 1, and D-galacturonic acid were significantly correlated with the levels of acute phase proteins (HP, LBP, \&alpha;2-HSG, and Lysozyme), suggesting acute phase response in HS-stressed pigs. These metabolites are expected to be novel biomarkers of chronic HS in pigs, yet the use of which awaits further validation.},

Often, researchers have not carefully considered each of these factors when evaluating connectivity and making conservation recommendations. We present a general method for efficient evaluation of functional connectivity for large numbers of native species across vast geographical areas. Connectivity was evaluated for 36 groups of species with different ecological associations; within each of these groups, northern Rocky Mountains. We quantified the extent and fragmentation of three dispersal abilities were evaluated across the United States predicted connected habitat for each of these 108 species and identify those for which the current landscape has the lowest area and the highest fragmentation of habitat. We then conducted a multivariate ordination and use landscape trajectory analysis to assess multivariate differences in the extent and fragmentation of connected habitat across taxa. We mapped habitat connectivity for each of the 108 species, quantified the extent and pattern of connected habitat for each species, identified which species have the most limited extent and most highly fragmented pattern of connected habitat, identified any groups of species with similar patterns of connected habitat across dispersal abilities, and quantified the sensitivity to landscape pattern of connected habitat to dispersal ability and different ecological associations. We found large differences among groups of species in terms of the extent and connectivity of habitat, and the sensitivity of connectivity to dispersal ability. Species with limited dispersal ability associated with low-elevation forest have the most limited and fragmented distribution of connected habitat. Species associated with high-elevation forest also appear highly vulnerable to habitat loss and fragmentation based on limited extents and connectivity of habitat.},

  abstract = {In nonhuman primate social groups, biological differences related to social status have proven useful for investigating the mechanisms of sensitivity to various disease states. Physiological and neurobiological differences between dominant and subordinate monkeys have been interpreted in the context of chronic social stress. The present experiments were designed to investigate the relationships between basal cortisol and testosterone concentrations and the establishment and maintenance of the social hierarchy in male cynomolgus monkeys. Cortisol concentrations were measured at baseline and following suppression with dexamethasone (DEX) and subsequent administration of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) while monkeys were individually housed (n = 20) and after 3 months of social housing (n = 4/group), by which time dominance hierarchies had stabilised. Cortisol was also measured during the initial 3 days of social housing. Neither pre-social housing hormone concentrations, nor hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis sensitivity predicted eventual social rank. During initial social housing, cortisol concentrations were significantly higher in monkeys that eventually became subordinate; this effect dissipated within 3 days. During the 12 weeks of social housing, aggressive and submissive behaviours were observed consistently, forming the basis for assignment of social ranks. At this time, basal testosterone and cortisol concentrations were significantly higher in dominant monkeys and, after DEX suppression, cortisol release in response to a challenge injection of ACTH was significantly greater in subordinates. These results indicate that basal cortisol and testosterone concentrations and HPA axis function are state variables that differentially reflect position in the dominance hierarchy, rather than trait variables that predict future social status.},

Undergraduate students (N = 51) then judged the veracity of these 30 clips and indicated how confident they were in their ratings.Results. Participants were more confident when judging native-language truth-tellers than second-language truth-tellers. In addition, participants were more likely to exhibit a truth-bias when observing native-language speakers, whereas they were more likely to exhibit a lie-bias when viewing second-language speakers.Conclusions. Given the difficulties and biases associated with second-language lie detection, further research is needed.},

Research has hitherto described the transition in rather general terms, and there is still only limited knowledge about how graduates construe themselves as professionals, or how they experience the transition to the sociocultural contexts of working life. In this study, the transition is viewed as a trajectory between different communities of practice. Three different Masters programmes at Linkoping University are focused on and compared: political science, psychology and mechanical engineering. The specific aims are to: (1) identify aspects of identity and knowledge formation as reported by informants, both as senior students and later as novice workers with 18 months of work experience; (2) identify features of discourses of knowledge and competence operating in the programmes and working life; and (3) to relate the results to differences in the way the programmes are designed. The results indicate that the psychology programme prepares for working life in a rational way, that is, the generic skills and substantive knowledge acquired seem to correspond to the demands of professional work. The other programmes stand out as preparing for working life either by providing generic skills that need to be transformed in professional work, or by containing elements that mainly play a ritual role rather than corresponding to the demands of working life.

  abstract = {Sirtuins (SIRTs) are nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent histone deacetylases with diverse physiological functions. A variety of small molecules have been developed to interrogate the physiological function of SIRTs. Therefore, it is desirable to establish efficient and convenient assays to screen SIRTs modulators. In this study, we designed a series of fluorescent nonapeptide probes derived from substrates of SIRT1–SIRT3. Fluorescence increment of these probes is based on SIRT-mediated removal of the acyl side chain with fluorophore, which makes this system free of lysine-recognizing protease. Comparing the reaction of these fluorescent nonapeptide substrates with SIRT1–SIRT3 and SIRT6, it was confirmed that this assessment system was the most suitable for SIRT2 activity detection. Thus, SIRT2 was used to modify substrates by truncating the amino acids or lysine side chain of nonapeptide. Finally, two specific and efficient fluorescent probes for SIRT2, ne-D9 and ne-K4a, were developed. Evaluation of the results revealed that ne-K4a based assay was more suitable for modulators screening in~vitro, while the other specific substrate ne-D9 was stable in cell lysate and could detect the activity of SIRT2 in the same. In summary, this study presents a novel strategy for detecting SIRT2 activity in~vitro and in cell lysate.},

In practice, however, we have not yet developed the scientific basis, nor the policy and finance mechanisms, for incorporating natural capital into resource- and land-use decisions on a large scale. Here, we propose a conceptual framework and sketch out a strategic plan for delivering on the promise of ecosystem services, drawing on emerging examples from Hawai‘i.

Such intraspecific differences in behaviour have been widely assumed to be non-adaptive variation surrounding (possibly) adaptive population-average behaviour. Nevertheless, in keeping with recent calls to apply Darwinian reasoning to ever-finer scales of biological variation, we sketch the fundamentals of an adaptive theory of consistent individual differences in behaviour. Our thesis is based on the notion that such 'personality differences' can be selected for if fitness payoffs are dependent on both the frequencies with which competing strategies are played and an individual's behavioural history. To this end, we review existing models that illustrate this and propose a game theoretic approach to analyzing personality differences that is both dynamic and state-dependent. Our motivation is to provide insights into the evolution and maintenance of an apparently common animal trait: personality, which has far reaching ecological and evolutionary implications.},

The aim of this study is to investigate how three different forms of intrinsic enrichment, namely, a hay ball without scent, a hay ball with catnip, and a hay ball with cinnamon, influenced the behavior of six cheetah and two Sumatran tigers at Fota Wildlife Park, Ireland. Enrichment-directed behaviors, as well as pacing, locomotion, inactive, and exploratory behaviors were investigated. The results indicated that the three forms of enrichment had similar effects, in terms of enrichment-directed behavior, with cinnamon resulting in the highest levels of enrichment-directed behaviors. The cinnamon treatment resulted in a significant decrease in pacing behavior when compared with baseline observations. No evidence of habituation (i.e., a significant reduction in enrichment-directed behaviors) was observed for any of the three enrichments. This means that these low cost, easy to apply, practical forms of enrichment could be frequently applied for these species as part of an enrichment regime.}

Measurements from Gage's skull and modern neuroimaging techniques were used to reconstitute the accident and determine the probable location of the lesion. The damage involved both left and right prefrontal cortices in a pattern that, as confirmed by Gage's modern counterparts, causes a defect in rational decision making and the processing of emotion.},

Based on the concepts of stress and coping, an extensive list of indicators of physical health, production, behavior, and physiology has been set up for the purpose of recognizing good from bad welfare. However, these indicators do not allow us to make any inference about mental states. This issue is important because welfare considerations apply to farm animals of different species and, within a given species, to animals of different ages, which are likely to have varying degrees of emotional and cognitive capacity. In the past, disagreements about exact definitions of emotion and cognition have blurred the matter and hampered research. However, this should no longer be the case; the study of emotions and feelings has emerged as a field of active research in psychology and neuroscience over the last two decades. It is now possible to go over philosophical discussions on the nature of feelings and to set up a research agenda on emotion and cognition in farm animals that should help us to understand their welfare requirements.},

High competition among large African carnivores, associated with extensive diet overlap, manifests in interactions between subordinate African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) and dominant lions (Panthera leo) and spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta). Using locations of large carnivores in Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park, South Africa, we found different responses from wild dogs to their two main competitors. Wild dogs avoided lions, particularly during denning, through a combination of spatial and temporal avoidance. However, wild dogs did not exhibit spatial or temporal avoidance of spotted hyenas, likely because wild dog pack sizes were large enough to adequately defend their kills. Understanding that larger carnivores affect the movements and space use of other carnivores is important for managing current small and fragmented carnivore populations, especially as reintroductions and translocations are essential tools used for the survival of endangered species, as with African wild dogs.

  abstract = {Taylor and colleagues (2000) proposed that males tend to display fight or flight responses to threat while females are more likely to display affiliative " tend or befriend " responses. In light of this hypothesis, gender differences in infant attachment behaviors were examined in a sample of 65 low-income mother– infant dyads, half of whom were referred to a home-based intervention service because of concerns about the quality of caregiving. Attachment behaviors were assessed in the Ainsworth Strange Situation when infants were 18 months old, and maternal behaviors were coded both for frightened or frightening behaviors, using the Main and Hesse (1992) coding inventory, and for disrupted affective communication using the Atypical Maternal Behavior Instrument for Assessment and Classification as-sessment tool (AMBIANCE; Lyons-Ruth, Bronfman, \& Parsons, 1999). Results indicated that as maternal behavior became more frightening, female infants tended to approach their mothers more than male infants. These gender differences in response to maternal frightening behavior also were evident in the clinically referred subsample. The results suggest that gender-based differences in tendencies to show affiliative behaviors to threat may complicate interpretation of attachment behavior in clinical contexts. RESUMEN: Taylor y sus colegas (2000) han sugerido que los hombres tienden a desplegar respuestas de " pelea o vete " ante una situación de amenaza, mientras que las mujeres son más propensas a desplegar respuestas afiliadas a " ocupémonos de esto o seamos amigos. " En atención a esta hipótesis, se examinaron las diferencias en cuanto el género sexual en las conductas afectivas del infante, en un grupo muestra de 65 pares de madre e hijo(a), de bajos recursos económicos, la mitad de los cuales fueron referidos a los servicios de una intervención en casa a causa de la preocupación acerca de la calidad de la prestación del cuidado. Las conductas afectivas fueron evaluadas usando el método de la Situación Extraña de Ainsworth cuando los infantes tenían 18 meses. Las conductas maternas fueron codificadas en cuanto a conductas que presentaban a una madre con miedo, o conductas maternas que producían miedo y preocupación, usando el inventario de codificación de Main y Hesse (1992), y en cuanto a la distorsión de la},

  abstract = {Introduction: Unhealthy weight loss practices are common among female college students. It is unknown if these practices are also most common among women in the subset of overweight or obese college students or if these practices are related to depression. We examined the relationship between gender, depression, and unhealthy weight loss practices among overweight or obese college students. Methods: Students (body mass index between 25.0 and 34.9kg/m2) from three Southern California universities (Mage=22years, SD=4; 70\% women) were recruited from May 2011 to May 2012 for participation in a weight loss clinical trial (N=404). Logistic regressions were performed with baseline data to assess the cross-sectional relationship between self-reported unhealthy weight loss practices and gender and depression as measured by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression short form. Results: Twenty-nine percent of participants reported engaging in at least one unhealthy weight loss behavior (e.g., fasting, purging) over the last 30days, with no differences by gender. Self-report of at least one unhealthy weight loss behavior was associated with report of symptoms of depression (eB=1.14 [confidence interval, CI: 1.08-1.20]), adjusting for potential confounders. Interactions between gender and depression were not significant (eB=1.04 [CI: 0.93-1.16]). Conclusion: Among an overweight or obese sample of college students, unhealthy weight loss practices were equally common in both genders, and students with depressive symptomatology were at greatest risk. Obesity interventions targeting overweight or obese college students should educate both men and women about the dangers of unhealthy weight loss practices. In addition, screening for depression can help identify students who would benefit from additional supportive and coping strategies and resources. © 2014.},

The present study was designed to increase understanding of visitor effect by assessing the relationship between visitor numbers and activity in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. An enzyme-immunoassay was successfully developed and validated to quantify urinary cortisol in spider monkeys. The physiological impact of visitors on the monkeys was then investigated by assessing the levels of urinary cortisol in samples collected when no visitors were in the zoo and throughout the year when visitor density fluctuated widely. Our results suggest that an increase in the number of visitors was associated with an increase in cortisol. This study supports previous behavioural research that visitors have a meaningful impact on primates in zoos. It also increases our understanding of visitor effect by assessing the relationship between absolute visitor numbers and an aspect of the animals' physiology. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The logit transformation is quite tractable mathematically, and it embodies the notion of threshold, which may have relevance for many of the variables that are of interest to investigators in the field of personality. Furthermore, investigators with experience in multiple linear regression or contingency table analysis should have little trouble in transitioning to logistic regression. Logistic regression programs are readily available in the major statistical packages, all of which provide fairly standard output.},

The objective of this research is to assess the extent to which social desirability biases relate to self-reported consumption, hazardous use, and harms. Methods: In each of two studies presented, undergraduate students (N = 391 and N = 177) who reported that they had consumed alcohol in the past year completed online confidential surveys. Results: Both studies show consistent associations between impression management bias and self-reported consumption such that high impression managers report 20 to 33\% less consumption and are about 50\% less likely to report risky drinking. No significant correlations involving consumption were found for self-deception bias. Study 2 also indicated that high impression managers report 30-50\% fewer acute harms following a drinking episode, and that these effects are maintained after controlling statistically for trait impulsivity/constraint. Conclusions: Impression management bias represents a significant threat to the validity of self-reported alcohol use and harms. Such bias may lead to misspecification of models and under-estimates of harmful or hazardous use. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Monte Carlo simulations on normal and lognormal data indicate that many of the tests commonly used are inappropriate or inefficient. Particular tests are recommended for unplanned multiple comparisons on the basis of controlling experimentwise type I error rate and providing maximum power. These include tests for parametric and nonparametric cases, equal and unequal sample sizes, homogeneous and heterogeneous variances, non-independent means (repeated measures or adjusted means), and comparing treatments to a control. Formulae and a worked example are provided. The problem of violations of assumptions, especially variance heterogeneity, was investigated using simulations, and particular strategies are recommended. The advantages and use of planned comparisons in ecology are discussed, and the philosophy of hypothesis testing with unplanned multiple comparisons is considered in relation to confidence intervals and statistical estimation. -Authors [Journal; In English]},

  abstract = {We provide an initial insight into the occurrence and characteristics of animal-visitor interactions (AVIs) involving captive wild animals within zoos and aquaria. Using information provided online via official public websites of modern zoos and aquaria, we found that AVIs were provided by the majority of facilities. Our study revealed that a variety of AVI types were being offered. Globally, petting captive wild animals was the most prevalent AVI type advertised (n = 1241 observations, 43\% (534) of facilities) and Mammalia was the most advertised taxonomic class (n = 5142; 53\% (2739)). We found certain AVI types that were more commonly offered than predicted. These were opportunities to: (1) Hand feed captive wild animals in Asia, North America and Oceania; (2) ride wild animals in Europe and North America; (3) walk with or swim through wild animal enclosures in Asia; and (4) walk with wild animals in Asia and Europe. Given the global prevalence of AVIs in modern zoos and aquaria, and an apparent lack of animal welfare focused research, we provide recommendations to help effectively balance and manage captive wild animal welfare with other primary interconnected goals.},

  abstract = {Captive animals are susceptible to chronic stress due to restricted space, lack of hiding places, presence of visitors, or the lack of resources that promote physical and mental stimuli. In birds, chronic stress can promote stereotypes, self-mutilation, feather picking, chewing on cage bars and walls, fearfulness and excessive aggression. Environmental enrichment (EE) becomes an important management tool to decrease chronic stress in captive animals. In our study, captive blue-and-yellow macaws (n = 22) kept in zoos in Brazil were exposed to EE in three experimental phases (pre-enrichment – no objects added to the cage; enrichment – physical, occupational and food items added; and post-enrichment – no objects added to the cage). Their behaviors were monitored by focal sampling and excreta were collected three times a week. Frequency of the behavior occurrence and correlation between behavioral data and corticosterone metabolites (CM) levels in droppings were assessed. “Vocalization”, “Movement” and “Resting” were the behaviors that occurred more frequently during the three phases. Abnormal behaviors showed no significant difference between phases, but “Biting itself” and “Pacing” decreased significantly from the pre-enrichment to the enrichment phase (p = 0.042 and p = 0.012, respectively), while “Standing on grid ceiling” increased significantly from pre-enrichment to enrichment phase (p = 0.002). Locomotion (p = 0.018) and movement (p = 0.003) were increased, whereas vocalization (p = 0.007), preening (p {$<$} 0.001) and feather bristling (p {$<$} 0.001) were reduced during the EE phase compared to the pre-enrichment phase. Macaws interacted more frequently with “Sunflower rolls” (24.4\%), “Stuffed pinecones” (21.1\%), “Dried corncobs” (17.0\%) and “Egg boxes” (13.3\%). Individual differences in preference for EE items were also observed. CM levels did not differ between the three phases (p = 0.798). “Locomotion” and CM levels were negatively correlated in the pre-enrichment phase (r = − 0.58; p = 0.033), suggesting that more active macaws cope better with stress. “Abnormal behaviors” were not correlated to CM levels. Our results provide evidence for the positive effects of EE on behavior and suggest that it could be used for improving the quality of life in parrots and other captive birds.},

Serologic screening for viral disease detection was negative, evidence of parasites was not detected, and results of a complete blood count and serum biochemical analysis were within reference intervals in all lions. The most relevant lesions observed were multiple areas of necrosis and hemorrhage in the intestinal outer muscular layer, and cellulitis with an intense bloody edema in the mesenteric and the pericardial fat tissue. On the basis of the fulminant course of the disease, the gross and histologic findings, and the isolation and identification of Clostridium sordellii, a diagnosis of infectious myositis and cellulitis associated with acute clostridiosis was made.

The protocol consists of a six-step process encompassing dedicated data acquisition and a specific ethical assessment. When the protocol was applied to assess a \&ldquo;giraffe feeding\&rdquo; interaction, steps devoted to data acquisition found that animal welfare risks were low, and that visitors described giraffes with emotionally linked descriptors more often after the interaction. The net promoter score, which refers to how likely visitors would recommend to a friend to join the animal\&ndash;visitor interaction, was 74\%. The subsequent ethical assessment, which consisted of a comparison of the results of the previous steps with an ethical matrix highlighting the ideal situation for all stakeholders\&rsquo; interests, allowed the overall identification of the ethical concerns entailed by the interaction. A final ethical checklist of the examined AVI had a \&ldquo;yes\&rdquo; in entries regarding animal welfare, emotional, and conservation mindedness outcomes and ethical assessment.},

  abstract = {Line-transect sampling is a strategy commonly used to assess richness and abundance of large diurnal vertebrates in tropical forests, but the relationships between the sampling eVort (measured as transect length in km) and the accuracy of the estimates based on the Weld data have rarely been investigated. Using data from 17 distinct surveys in French Guiana, we demonstrated that 85 km of transect are suYcient to extrapolate species richness whatever the forest type and the disturbance level of the habitat. Concerning spe- cies abundances, reliable estimations were obtained after 40–90 km of transects for large birds, howlers, tamarins, and agoutis. In contrast, relative abundances of capucins, sakis, and ungulates, were still not stabilized after 100 km but can still be reliably assessed with this eVort. These species have larger home range than the former, and the accuracy of abun- dance assessment may be related to use of space. Since species with small area require- ments regularly use their entire home range, abundance prediction with a moderate sampling eVort may be facilitated. On the contrary, species with large home ranges may exhibit strong seasonal habitat partitioning, therefore decreasing the accuracy of abundance estimation on a low-eVort survey. This analysis provides the Wrst evidence of the minimal eVorts required to assess large vertebrate richness and relative abundance of some species in a neotropical rainforest. We encourage similar works on other sites, to collect additional information on the inXuence of forest productivity and species assemblage composition on the minimal required sampling eVort. This would permit conWdent extrapolations of species richness and abundance in other Neotropical forests and may provide eYcient guidelines to integrate the predictive analytical tool developed in this work in future biodiversity management plans},

However, the functional organization of the STS remains debated: Is this broad region composed of multiple functionally distinct modules, each specialized for a different process, or are STS subregions multifunctional, contributing to multiple processes? Is the STS spatially organized, and if so, what are the dominant features of this organization? We address these questions by measuring STS responses to a range of social and linguistic stimuli in the same set of human participants, using fMRI. We find a number of STS subregions that respond selectively to certain types of social input, organized along a posterior-to-anterior axis. We also identify regions of overlapping response to multiple contrasts, including regions responsive to both language and theory of mind, faces and voices, and faces and biological motion. Thus, the human STS contains both relatively domain-specific areas, and regions that respond to multiple types of social information.},

It is common opinion that more effective control tools such as new diagnostics, a new vaccine and new drugs are urgently needed to control the global pandemic, though the so far insufficient understanding of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) mechanism of pathogenesis is a major obstacle for the development of these control tools. In this review, we will summarize the recent advancement in the understanding of Mtb biology and on the pathogenesis of Mtb infection with emphasis on latent infection, with the change in paradigm of the last few years where the dichotomy between latent and active disease has been reconsidered in favor of a dynamic equilibrium between the host and the bacilli, encompassing a continuous spectrum of conditions that has been named TB spectrum. Implications for the diagnosis and control of disease in certain population will also be discussed.},

The publications reviewed here were collected to better appreciate the cortical lateralization of emotional perception (visual and auditory), expression (facial and prosodic), and experience. Four major models of emotional processing are discussed--the Right Hemisphere, Valence, Approach-Withdrawal, and Behavioral Inhibition System-Behavioral Activation System models. Observing the relative merits and limitations of these models, a new direction for exploration is offered. Specifically, to better appreciate the strength and direction (i.e., approach versus withdrawal) of experienced emotions, it is recommended that state "dominance" be evaluated in the context of asymmetrical activation of left-frontal (dominance) versus right-frontal (submission) brain regions.},

  abstract = {This study tested the reliability of a Qualitative Behavioural Assessment (QBA) protocol developed for the Norwegian Sheep House (F\&aring;reBygg) project. The aim was to verify whether QBA scores were consistent between different observers, i.e., inter-observer reliability, and between scorings of the same observers on different time points, i.e., intra-observer reliability. Six trained observers, including two veterinary students, two animal welfare inspectors and two sheep farmers observed sheep in 16 videos, and independently scored 14 pre-defined behavioural descriptors on visual analogue scales (VAS). The procedure was repeated one week after the first scoring session. QBA scores were analysed using Principal Component Analysis. Inter- and intra-observer agreement was assessed using Kendall\&rsquo;s coefficient of concordance (W). Principal component 1 (PC 1) and 2 (PC 2) combined explained \&gt;60\% of the total variation in the QBA scores in both scoring sessions. PC 1 (44.5\% in sessions 1 and 2) ranged from the positive descriptors calm, content, relaxed and friendly to the negative descriptors uneasy, vigilant and fearful, and was therefore labelled mood. PC 2 (18\% in session 1, 16.6\% in session 2) ranged from bright to dejected and apathetic, and was therefore labelled arousal. Kendall\&rsquo;s coefficient of concordance of PC 1 for all observers was high in the two scoring sessions (W = 0.87 and 0.85, respectively), indicating good inter-observer reliability. For PC 2, the agreement for all observers was moderate in both video sessions (W = 0.45 and 0.65). The intra-observer agreement was very high for all observers for PC 1 (W \&gt; 0.9) except for one, where the agreement was considered to be high (W = 0.89). For PC 2, Kendall\&rsquo;s coefficient was very high for the veterinary students and interpreted as moderate for the two farmers and welfare inspectors. This study indicates that the QBA approach and the terms included in the F\&aring;rebygg protocol were reliable for assessing video recordings of sheep behaviour when applied by trained observers, regardless of whether they were a veterinary student, animal welfare inspector or sheep farmer. Further work is needed to examine the reliability of the QBA protocol when tested on-farms for sheep managed under Norwegian housing systems.},

  abstract = {The substantial understanding that has been gained over the past 5 decades of the biology of blood formation is largely due to the development of functional quantitative assays for cells at all stages of differentiation, from multipotential stem cells to mature cells. The majority of studies have involved the mouse because the ease with which repopulation studies can be carried out with this animal model allows the assay of complete lineage development from stem cells. In the past decade, advances in repopulation assays for human stem cells using xenotransplantation have greatly enhanced our understanding of human stem cell biology. Importantly, the xenotransplantation methodology has also been used to identify the cancer stem cell that initiates and sustains leukemic proliferation, providing key evidence for the cancer stem cell hypothesis. This hypothesis argues that cancer cells are functionally heterogeneous and hierarchically organized such that only specific cells are capable of sustaining tumor growth and continuously producing the cells that make up the bulk of the tumor. Recent studies have also brought into focus the importance of the intimate relationship between the stem cell (normal or leukemic) and its microenvironment. Coming into view are the molecular players involved in stem cell homing, migration, and adhesion, as well as the cellular components of the microenvironmental niche. Here we review recent studies that have begun, to elucidate the interplay between normal and leukemic human stem cells and their microenvironment.},

  abstract = {Continues the authors' (see record 1979-13073-001) study of learned helplessness. Previous findings indicate that helpless children attributed their failure to lack of ability and viewed them as insurmountable. Mastery-oriented children, in contrast, tended to emphasize motivational factors and to view failure as surmountable. Although the performance of the 2 groups was usually identical during success or prior to failure, research suggested that these groups may well differ in the degree to which they perceived that their successes are replicable and their failures are avoidable. In the present study, 56 male and 56 female 4th–6th graders performed a task on which they encountered success and then failure. 56 Ss were asked a series of questions about their performance after success and 56 after failure. Compared to mastery-oriented Ss, helpless Ss underestimated the number of successes (and overestimated the number of failures), did not view successes as indicative of ability, and did not expect the successes to continue. Subsequent failure led them to devalue their performance but left the mastery-oriented Ss undaunted. Thus, for helpless children, successes are less salient, less predictive, and less enduring—less successful. (19 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {This chapter discusses the functional relation between perception and behavior. It presents a general perspective on perception and action along with elaborating the direct relation between perception and behavior and specifically on one consequence of this relation—namely, the imitation. The chapter describes the core concepts of social perception. Furthermore, the chapter examines all three forms of social perception that lead directly to corresponding overt behavioral tendencies. The cognitive approach that has dominated psychology for over 30 years has changed psychology's perspective on perception. Certainly, perception is essential for us to comprehend our environment but that does not mean that this understanding is an end in itself. The chapter concludes with a discussion on the perception-behavior link from a functional perspective. In specific, perception provides an understanding of the world. Social perception refers to the activation of a perceptual representation, which generally has a direct effect on social behavior. Perceptual inputs are translated automatically into corresponding behavioral outputs.},

I contend that all of Dobzhansky's arguments hinge upon sectarian claims about God's nature, actions, purposes, or duties. Moreover, Dobzhansky's theology manifests several tensions, both in the epistemic justification of his theological claims and in their collective coherence. I note that other prominent biologists-such as Mayr, Dawkins, Eldredge, Ayala, de Beer, Futuyma, and Gould-also use theology-laden arguments. I recommend increased analysis of the justification, complexity, and coherence of this theology. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Evidence is accumulating that individuals from the same population differ in the degree and extent of this form of phenotypic plasticity. We here discuss how such between-individual differences in behavioural plasticity can result from additive and interactive effects of genetic make-up and past environmental conditions, and under which conditions natural selection might favour this form of between-individual variation. We highlight how spatial or temporal variation in the environment, in combination with competition among individuals, can promote adaptive individual differences in plasticity; and we detail how differences in plasticity can emerge as a result of selection pressures induced by social interactions or as a response to between-individual differences in state. We further discuss both ecological and evolutionary consequences of individual differences in plasticity. We outline, for example, how individual differences in plasticity can have knock-on effects on the rate of evolution; and how such differences can enhance the stability and persistence of populations. ?? 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

  abstract = {The goal of this book is to provide a concise but lucid explanation and deriva-tion of the fundamentals of spread-spectrum communication systems.Althoughspread-spectrum communication is a staple topic in textbooks on digital com-munication, itstreatment is usually cursory, and the subject warrants a moreintensive exposition. Originally adopted in military networks as a means of ensuring secure communication when confronted with the threats of jammingand interception, spread-spectrum systems are now the core of commercial ap- plications such as mobile cellular and satellite communication. The level of presentation in this book is suitable for graduate students with a prior graduate-level course in digital communication and for practicing engineers with a solid background in the theory of digital communication. As the title indicates, this book stresses principles rather than specific current or planned systems, whichare described in many other books. Although the expositionemphasizes the-oretical principles, the choice of specific topics is tempered by my judgment of their practical significance and interest to both researchers and systemdesign-ers. Throughout the book, learning is facilitated by many new or streamlined derivations of the classical theory. Problems at the end of each chapter areintended to assist readers in consolidating their knowledge and to provide prac-tice in analytical techniques. The book is largelyself-containedmathematically because of the four appendices, which give detailedderivations of mathematicalresultsused in the main text.In writing this book, I have relied heavily on notes and documents prepared and the perspectives gained during my work at the US Army Research Labo-ratory. Many colleagues contributed indirectly to this effort. I am grateful tomy wife, Nancy, who provided me not only with her usual unwavering support but also with extensive editorial assistance.},

  abstract = {Due to anthropogenic pressures, African lion (Panthera leo) populations in Kenya and Tanzania are increasingly limited to fragmented populations. Lions living on isolated habitat patches exist in a matrix of less-preferred habitat. A framework of habitat patches within a less-suitable matrix describes a metapopulation. Metapopulation analysis can provide insight into the dynamics of each population patch in reference to the system as a whole, and these analyses often guide conservation planning. We present the first metapopulation analysis of African lions. We use a spatially-realistic model to investigate how sex-biased dispersal abilities of lions affect patch occupancy and also examine whether human densities surrounding the remaining lion populations affect the metapopulation as a whole. Our results indicate that male lion dispersal ability strongly contributes to population connectivity while the lesser dispersal ability of females could be a limiting factor. When populations go extinct, recolonization will not occur if distances between patches exceed female dispersal ability or if females are not able to survive moving across the matrix. This has profound implications for the overall metapopulation; the female models showed an intrinsic extinction rate from five-fold to a hundred-fold higher than the male models. Patch isolation is a consideration for even the largest lion populations. As lion populations continue to decline and with local extinctions occurring, female dispersal ability and the proximity to the nearest lion population are serious considerations for the recolonization of individual populations and for broader conservation efforts.},

These ancient neuropeptides display a marked conservation in gene structure and expression, yet diversity in the genetic regulation of their receptors seems to underlie natural variation in social behavior, both between and within species. Human studies are beginning to explore the roles of these neuropeptides in social cognition and behavior and suggest that variation in the genes encoding their receptors may contribute to variation in human social behavior by altering brain function. Understanding the neurobiology and neurogenetics of social cognition and behavior has important implications, both clinically and for society.},

Using a large and diverse sample of San Francisco Bay Area high school students (N = 7,836), we found that both authoritarian and permissive parenting styles were negatively associated with grades, and authoritative parenting was positively associated with grades. Parenting styles generally showed the expected relation to grades across gender, age, parental education, ethnic, and family structure categories. Authoritarian parenting tended to have a stronger association with grades than did the other 2 parenting styles, except among Hispanic males. The full typology best predicted grades among white students. Pure authoritative families (high on authoritative but not high on the other 2 indices) had the highest mean grades, while inconsistent families that combine authoritarian parenting with other parenting styles had the lowest grades.},

We have assessed the patterns of genomic diversity for ninety feline microsatellite loci among previously characterized populations of cheetahs, lions and pumas in recapitulating demographic history. The results imply that the microsatellite diversity measures (heterozygosity, allele reconstitution and microsatellite allele variance) offer proportionate indicators, albeit with large variance, of historic population bottlenecks and founder effects. The observed rate of reconstruction of new alleles plus the growth in the breadth of microsatellite allele size (variance) was used here to develop genomic estimates of time intervals following historic founder events in cheetahs (12,000 yr ago), in North American pumas (10,000-17,000 yr ago), and in Asiatic lions of the Gir Forest (1000-4000 yr ago).},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To review the evidence supporting the biopsychosocial model in understanding patients with gastrointestinal disorders (GI).\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHOD: Essay of personal experience and review of related literature through a MEDLINE search.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: Through clinical examples of three common gastrointestinal disorders, a case is made to refocus our understanding from a biomedical or disease-based model of illness to a biopsychosocial model. With the latter model, the psychosocial and biological predeterminants are seen to interact in the clinical expression of illness and disease. With gastroesophageal reflux disease, the evidence shows that stress can lead to amplification of heartburn symptoms that is independent of the degree of reflux. Functional gastrointestinal pain is "an illness without disease," where structural or physiological disturbance of the GI system does not exist. Rather, the symptoms are understood in terms of visceral hypersensitivity as modulated by central nervous system activity. With the Crohn's disease example, the clinical expression of the disorder is not explained by the degree of disease activity. Rather, the symptoms and impaired quality of life relate to preexisting psychosocial determinants. The observed association of stress with disease activation in Crohn's disease is explained by stress-related alterations in psychoimmunological function via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: Gastrointestinal disorders, as a model for other medical conditions, exemplify the important role of an integrated, biopsychosocial model of illness.},

METHODS: In a 3-day, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, the behavioral, cognitive, motor, and endocrine effects of 0 mg, 2.5 mg, and 5 mg intravenous Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta-9-THC) were characterized in 13 stable, antipsychotic-treated schizophrenia patients. These data were compared with effects in healthy subjects reported elsewhere. RESULTS: Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol transiently increased 1) learning and recall deficits; 2) positive, negative, and general schizophrenia symptoms; 3) perceptual alterations; 4) akathisia, rigidity, and dyskinesia; 5) deficits in vigilance; and 6) plasma prolactin and cortisol. Schizophrenia patients were more vulnerable to Delta-9-THC effects on recall relative to control subjects. There were no serious short- or long-term adverse events associated with study participation. CONCLUSIONS: Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol is associated with transient exacerbation in core psychotic and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. These data do not provide a reason to explain why schizophrenia patients use or misuse cannabis. Furthermore, Delta-9-THC might differentially affect schizophrenia patients relative to control subjects. Finally, the enhanced sensitivity to the cognitive effects of Delta-9-THC warrants further study into whether brain cannabinoid receptor dysfunction contributes to the pathophysiology of the cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia.},

In a 3-day, double-blind, randomized, and counterbalanced study, the behavioral, cognitive, and endocrine effects of 0, 2.5, and 5 mg intravenous delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta-9-THC) were characterized in 22 healthy individuals, who had been exposed to cannabis but had never been diagnosed with a cannabis abuse disorder. Prospective safety data at 1, 3, and 6 months poststudy was also collected. Delta-9-THC (1) produced schizophrenia-like positive and negative symptoms; (2) altered perception; (3) increased anxiety; (4) produced euphoria; (5) disrupted immediate and delayed word recall, sparing recognition recall; (6) impaired performance on tests of distractibility, verbal fluency, and working memory (7) did not impair orientation; (8) increased plasma cortisol. These data indicate that Delta-9-THC produces a broad range of transient symptoms, behaviors, and cognitive deficits in healthy individuals that resemble some aspects of endogenous psychoses.

One hundred participants were asked to produce veridical and false statements in either their first or second language. Pupil size, speech latencies, and utterance durations were analyzed. Results showed additive effects of statement veracity and the language in which these statements were produced. That is, false statements elicited larger pupil dilations and longer naming latencies compared with veridical statements, and statements in the foreign language elicited larger pupil dilations and longer speech durations and compared with first language. Importantly, these two effects did not interact, suggesting that the processing cost associated with deception is similar in a native and foreign language. The theoretical implications of these observations are discussed.},

  abstract = {A brief history of the concept of sentience is given. It is pointed out that the idea of sentience, at least in the mammals and birds, was accepted by lay people by the time of the Renaissance and before it was acknowledged by philosophers. It was not until the Enlightenment of the 18th century that philosophers started to accept the notion that animals have feelings. Towards the end of the 19th century, scientists and philosophers had developed a fairly sophisticated concept of sentience. Little consideration was given to sentience by scientists through much of the 20th century due to the inhibiting influence of Behaviourism. In the last quarter of the 20th century, there was a surge of interest in animal sentience, and animal welfare scientists quickly realised that welfare problems can be better tackled with an understanding of how animals feel. Methods to investigate indirectly how animals feel are described and areas requiring further elucidation are listed. © 2006.},

Prior to release, long-term monitoring and assessment of behavior is required to determine whether prides and coalitions behave naturally and are sufficiently adapted to a wild environment. Social network analysis (SNA) can be used to provide insight into how the pride as a whole and individuals within it, function. Our study was conducted upon 2 captive-origin prides who are part of an ex situ reintroduction program, and 1 wild pride of African lion. Social interactions were collected at all occurrence for each pride and categorized into greet, social grooming, play, and aggression. Betweenness centrality showed that offspring in each pride were central to the play network, whereas degree indicated that adults received (indegree) the greatest number of overall social interactions, and the adult males of each pride were least likely to initiate (outdegree) any interactions. Through the assessment of individual centrality and degree values, a social keystone adult female was identified for each pride. Social network results indicated that the 2 captive-origin prides had formed cohesive social units and possessed relationships and behaviors comparable with the wild pride for the studied behaviors. This study provided the first SNA comparison between captive-bred origin and a wild pride of lions, providing valuable information on individual and pride sociality, critical for determining the success of prides within an ex situ reintroduction program.},

We conducted the first exploration into the personality of a captive-origin pride of African lions (Panthera leo), assessing behavioural variations and consistencies in daily activity, social and hunting behaviour, and boldness. Data were collected via direct observations, while a species-specific protocol for testing boldness, using playbacks, was developed. Differences in sex, age and session time for the activity budget were evaluated using Pearson correlations and repeated-measures ANOVA, while social interactions were analysed using social network analysis. Spearman’s correlations were conducted to assess for associations between boldness scores, activity and sociality. The two boldness tests provided a range of scores per lion, indicating that the test was effective. Correlations and variations in individual behaviour indicated that adults and sub-adults have specific roles within pride behaviour. Correlations between boldness and activity and social behaviours provided information on the role of individuals, allowing investigation into the behaviour of a dominant and a social keystone. Our study indicates that evaluating various aspects of behaviour in conjunction with boldness has the potential to assist the pre-release assessment of a pride within an ex situ reintroduction program.},

We conducted the first study to compare activity budgets of prides of captive-origin African lions (Panthera leo) to a wild pride investigated under the same methodologies. Behavioural data were collected via direct observations of individual lions. The vegetation type in which each pride was located was recorded at the beginning and end of each observation session. Behaviours were analysed via linear mixed models, using restricted maximum-likelihood analysis. Age, sex, origin, time observed and vegetation type were fitted as fixed factors to assess the main effects of significant interactions, while average temperature was fitted as a covariate. Resting and alert behaviours were found to vary at sex and age levels, with expected peaks and lows coinciding with observation session times. Captive-origin prides showed a decrease in resting and increase in alert and movement behaviours post-1700 hours, while this behavioural change was not observed for the wild prides. Males of the wild prides were observed to rest more than captive-origin counterparts, while this variation was not observed for females across origins. Vegetation was found to influence behaviour, with cubs being more alert and active in riverbed vegetation, and adults and sub-adults in shrubland. Overall, all prides were observed to exhibit behaviours at natural levels. This study provides a comprehensive assessment of the daily activity of lions critical to the pre-release evaluation of prides within an ex situ reintroduction program.},

  abstract = {1. This study utilizes a unique data set covering over 19 000 georeferenced records of species presence collected between 1993 and 2008, to explore the distribution and habitat selectivity of an assemblage of 26 carnivore species in the Serengeti-Ngorongoro landscape in northern Tanzania. 2. Two species, the large-spotted genet and the bushy-tailed mongoose, were documented for the first time within this landscape. Ecological Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA) was used to examine habitat selectivity for 18 of the 26 carnivore species for which there is sufficient data. Eleven ecogeographical variables (EGVs), such as altitude and habitat type, were used for these analyses. 3. The ENFA demonstrated that species differed in their habitat selectivity, and supported the limited ecological information already available for these species, such as the golden jackals' preference for grassland and the leopards' preference for river valleys. 4. Two aggregate scores, marginality and tolerance, are generated by the ENFA, and describe each species' habitat selectivity in relation to the suite of EGVs. These scores were used to test the hypothesis that smaller species are expected to be more selective than larger species [Science, 1989, 243, 1145]. Two predictions were tested: Marginality should decrease with body mass; and tolerance should increase with body mass. Our study provided no evidence for either prediction. 5. Our results not only support previous analyses of carnivore diet breadth, but also represent a novel approach to the investigation of habitat selection across species assemblages. Our method provides a powerful tool to explore similar questions in other systems and for other taxa.},

  abstract = {The increased risk of disease and decreased capacity to respond to tissue insult in the setting of aging results from complex changes in homeostatic mechanisms, including the regulation of oxidative stress and cellular heterogeneity. In aged skin, the healing capacity is markedly diminished resulting in a high risk for chronic wounds. Stem cell-based therapies have the potential to enhance cutaneous regeneration, largely through trophic and paracrine activity. Candidate cell populations for therapeutic application include adult mesenchymal stem cells, embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells. Autologous cell-based approaches are ideal to minimize immune rejection but may be limited by the declining cellular function associated with aging. One strategy to overcome age-related impairments in various stem cell populations is to identify and enrich with functionally superior stem cell subsets via single cell transcriptomics. Another approach is to optimize cell delivery to the harsh environment of aged wounds via scaffold-based cell applications to enhance engraftment and paracrine activity of therapeutic stem cells. In this review, we shed light on challenges and recent advances surrounding stem cell therapies for wound healing and discuss limitations for their clinical adoption. © 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel.},

TB control is high on the inter-national public health agenda, not only because of the enor-mous burden of disease, but also because short-course chemotherapy (SCC) is recognized as one of the most cost-effective of all health interventions (Jamison and others 1993). That recognition is partly attributable to an influential series of studies done in three of the poorest countries of southeastern Africa (Malawi, Mozambique, and Tanzania), which suggested that a year of healthy life could be gained for less than about US\$5 (de Jonghe and others 1994; Murray and others 1991). This evidence has been central to the global promotion of the DOTS strategy, the package of measures combining best practices in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with active TB, in which direct observation of treatment during SCC is a key element (WHO 2002a, 2004c). Although the World Health Organization (WHO) has fos-tered the implementation of DOTS over the past decade, four recent developments have drawn attention to a wider range of options for TB control: • First, many more studies have investigated the costs, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of different approaches to TB control. They are mostly studies of ways to improve the delivery of first-line drug treatment for active disease, but they include some investigations of preventive therapy (treat-ment of latent infection), treatment of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) using both first-and second-line drugs, and different approaches to diagnosis. They have been carried out in a variety of settings, in richer as well as poorer coun-tries. The results have not been fully synthesized but may suggest ways to enhance DOTS. • Second, striking increases in TB have been associated with the spread of HIV infection and drug resistance, suggesting that DOTS alone may not be enough to bring TB under control, especially in Africa and in the countries of the former Soviet Union. • Third, there is now substantially more investment in new tools for TB control, including multimillion-dollar initia-tives to develop better diagnostics, drugs, and vaccines, many of which operate under the umbrella of the Stop TB Partnership (see http://www.stoptb.org). Some of the possi-ble products of this new research would stimulate reevalua-tions of the current reliance on chemotherapy, especially the development of a new high-efficacy vaccine. • Fourth, interest in TB is renascent, not simply as the out-come of mycobacterial infection, but also as the conse-quence of exposure to exacerbating risks, such as tobacco smoke, air pollution, malnutrition, overcrowding, and poor access to health services. Research directed at quantifying these risks will also suggest ways to minimize them.},

  abstract = {Assessing the Impact of the Rise in CO2: A doubling of the present atmospheric CO2 concentration is likely to occur by the end of the next century and will have many effects on trees and forests. There may be major changes in climate, especially temperature and precipitation, that will affect the growth and ecology of trees and forests: there will be substantial effects on the growth and ecology of trees and forests as a result of the direct effects of CO2 on the physiology of trees. To a considerable extent the consequences of an increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration on climate are speculative, whereas many of the direct effects of an increase in CO2 concentration on the physiology and growth of plants have been established through experimentation and are quite well known and understood. There are several reasons for showing active concern about the consequences of the rise in CO2 concentration for trees and forests: to enhance knowledge, at a fundamental level, about the functioning of woodlands and forests; to assess the likely impact on their ecology, productivity and value; and to anticipate any significant downstream, socio-economic consequences. The consequences of the rise in CO2 concentration may be assessed at a range of temporal and spatial scales: from seconds to centuries, from cell to region. Biological information about the effects of CO2 on plants is generally available at short time scales and small spatial scales, whereas ecological and socio-economic concern is largely expressed with respect to the much larger scales of the stand and the forest over tens or hundreds of years. There are major problems with the data currently available. The environmental conditions pertaining in the majority of the experiments (e.g. soil type, temperature) differ significantly from forest conditions throughout the boreal and temperate regions. Secondly, the use of juvenile trees in growth cabinets and rooms makes extrapolation to the field situation difficult. Finally, the use to pot-grown plants with a limited soil volume, and all the problems of nutrient depletion that this entails, imposes severe constraints on the interpretations of changes in plant nutrient contents, assimilation rates and growth. Photosynthesis and Stomatal Action: The primary role of CO2 as a substrate for photosynthesis is well understood and there are no reasons to suppose that effects of CO2 concentration on the primary carboxylation are any different in trees from other plants with the C3 pathway. However, the role of CO2 as an effective activator and regulator of rubisco is only currently being unravelled. In general, photosynthesis increases substantially, but less than proportionately (up to 75\%), in response to a doubling in ambient CO2 concentration, but a lack of response, or even a reduction in rate of photosynthesis, has been observed. There is increasing evidence that maintenance of active sinks for assimilate is necessary for the effective stimulation of photosynthesis by an increase in CO2 concentration. Constrained rooting of pot-grown trees and the lack of alternative sinks as a result of determinate growth, may be the reason why a strong, positive response has not always been seen and why the assimilation rate declines with time in many of the experiments. Closure of stomata in response to stress may also negate the increase from CO2 fertilization. When plants are grown for extended periods in elevated CO2 so that they may become acclimated, the increase in rate of photosynthesis is less than in short-term experiments. Analysis of A/Ci response functions indicates that this may result from a reduction in the activity of rubisco, although it is not clear whether the amount or the activation state of the enzyme is reduced, or from Pi limitation. Stomatal conductance generally declines with an increase in CO2 concentration to between 0 to 70\% of the control. There is considerable variation in response and in some trees, particularly conifers, stomatal conductance is rather unresponsive to changes in ambient CO2 concentration. The lack of a mechanistic understanding of the role of CO2 in stomatal action prevents explanation at present. There is some evidence that a reduction in the number of stomata per unit area or per unit epidermal cell may also contribute to the reduction in stomatal conductance of plants grown at high CO2 concentrations, but both increases and decreases have been observed in trees. It is not clear whether these changes are the result of acclimation of developmental processes, ecological selection or genetic adaptation. There may be other presently unknown effects of CO2 concentration on growth processes at the cellular level. In particular, the effects of CO2 concentration on leaf growth may not be explicable solely in terms of substrate supply and there may be effects of CO2 on leaf initiation, development and expansion in other ways. Tree Growth: Growth of seedlings and young trees of both broadleaves and conifers is increased by a doubling of the ambient CO2 concentration. The observed magnitude of the response ranges from 20 to 120\% with a median of ca 40\%. Both root and shoot growth are increased. Young trees grow faster in high CO2 but normal ontogenetic processes occur. In general, the experiments suffer from a number of inadequacies and this may explain the variability of response. In particular nearly all the experiments have been short-term (less than 12 months) on very young trees, that are often pot-bound and with growth restricted by lack of sinks and in a nutrient-deficient condition. Very low relative growth rates indicate far from good growth conditions. Increases in growth in response to increase in CO2 concentration occur in stress conditions and can ameliorate to a large extent the influence of stresses (water, nutrient, low light) on growth. Nutrient deficiency enhances biomass partitioning to the roots, whereas with free nutrient supply, an increase in CO2 concentration leads to a relative enhancement of leaf growth. Acclimation to nutrient depletion, evident as increased nutrient use efficiency, may occur but its extent and long-term significance remains uncertain. Enhanced fine-root mass and increased mycorrhizal infection may be significant in this respect, in addition to changes in root uptake processes. The combination of enhanced assimilation and reduced stomatal condutance at elevated CO2 leads to an increase in water use efficiency at the leaf and seedling scales in controlled environments, but it is not known whether this occurs at the stand scale in the field. Because trees are perennial, a small increase in relative growth rate of 0.1\% per day, at the prevailing low growth rates in many of the experiments, should lead to a large difference in individual tree size after a number of years. Whether CO2 fertilization will have this effect is however, uncertain. A major gap in our knowledge is related to the influence of elevated CO2 levels on yield quality (wood density, knottiness, etc.). Stand Processes and Production: The experimental approach is not practical with older trees, stands and forests. The effects of CO2 on assimilation, water use and other processes at the stand or larger scales, can only be assessed through models. Models of stand processes in relation to a doubling of CO2 concentration, taking into account acclimation to CO2 at the leaf scale, indicate a substantial increase in stand CO2-assimilation and in water use efficiency. However, the information available to parameterize such models may not be appropriate because it has been derived from seedlings that were only partially acclimated. Experimentation on mature trees is technically feasible but logistically and financially difficult. A more feasible approach available may be to use portions of mature trees, such as branches, in large cuvettes to obtain data required for the parameterization of stand-scale models that are used to make predictions of the likely consequences of the increase in the atmospheric CO2 concentration for stand functioning. Micro-meteorological changes within the cuvettes and changes in feedback loops between the enclosed portion and the atmosphere, must, of course, be taken into account as well as the physiological consequences of treating only part of the plant. Such models require to be carefully tested at the present CO2 concentration and in relation to other environmental variables, since they cannot be tested in a doubled CO2 environment in forests. Changes in tree canopy structure may also influence canopy functioning as well as understorey species composition and growth: changes in the pattern of branching and in internode length, as a result of enhanced CO2 concentrations, have been observed, for example. However, models that include feedbacks such as interactions between CO2 and crown structure, growth and respiration of trees, or leaf composition and rates of litter decomposition, are not presently available. Whether changes in harvest index and wood quality will ensue at the stand scale cannot be predicted at present. Forest and Region: At larger scales, a very complex network of processes must be taken into consideration and there is quite insufficient information about the effects of CO2 on these processes to permit reasonable predictions. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc.

This hypothesis has been tested for several helminth parasites, but not for microparasites. We therefore examined dose-response patterns for the microparasitic bacterium Pasteuria ramosa and the fungus Metschnikowiella biscuspidata infecting the planktonic crustacean Daphnia magna. With increasing numbers of transmission stages administered to the host we found that host fecundity and survival and parasite transmission-stage production declined. Using a k-value analysis, a method that quantifies the strength of density dependence, we found for both parasites that density dependence acted at all doses, indicating the absence of a minimum density below which parasite fitness is density-independent. At low doses density was exactly compensated, but it was overcompensated at high doses. Overcompensation at high doses was weak for P. ramosa, but high for M. biscuspidata. At the two highest doses M. biscuspidata killed its hosts before any transmission stages were produced. Our data indicate that density dependence is expressed through retarded spore development in P. ramosa, but through both host mortality and reduced parasite fecundity in M. biscuspidata. A further experiment (P. ramosa only) revealed that in well-fed hosts more parasite transmission stages are produced than in poorly fed hosts, suggesting that competition for host resources retards P. ramosa development. Our data for P. ramosa, but not for M. biscuspidata, are largely consistent with assumptions made in models on microparasite epidemiology. We draw attention to the relevance of dose effects and within-host competition for the evolution of virulence.},

In this paper, we present the incorporation of the alphabeta filter to DFA to determine patterns in the power-law behavior that can be found in these correlations. Well-known simulated scenarios and real data involving normal and pathological circumstances were used to evaluate this process. The results presented here suggest the existence of evolving patterns, not always following a uniform power-law behavior, that cannot be described by scaling exponents estimated using a linear procedure over two predefined ranges. Instead, the power law is observed to have a continuous variation with segment length. We also show that the study of these patterns, avoiding initial assumptions about the nature of the data, may confer advantages to DFA by revealing more clearly abnormal physiological conditions detected in congestive heart failure patients related to the existence of dominant characteristic scales.},

Based on the             C             language, it uses a number of macros and other low-level constructs to exchange data structures between the             R             process and any dynamically-loaded component modules authors added to it. With the introduction of the             Rcpp             package, and its later refinements, this process has become considerably easier yet also more robust.

Seventy-two mixed parity sows received either 1 kg lucerne hay daily from entry into the farrowing crate (\&minus;2 d from expected farrowing date) until weaning at 17 d (lucerne group, n = 36), or received no additional enrichment (control group, n = 36). In the 18 h prior to farrowing, the sows in the lucerne treatment spent more time performing nest-building behaviour (14.8\% lucerne vs 11.1\% control, p = 0.0009) and less time sham-chewing (1.0\% lucerne vs 1.9\% control, p = 0.01) than control sows, and gave birth to fewer stillborn piglets/litter (0.1 lucerne vs 0.4 control, p = 0.027). After farrowing (Day 3), the control sows spent less time lying than the lucerne sows (26\% control vs 43\% lucerne, p \&lt; 0.05). The control sows also spent less time interacting with their piglets during early lactation compared to late lactation (25.5\% Day 5 vs 47.3\% Day 12, p \&lt; 0.05), suggesting reduced maternal behaviour in this group. The lucerne sows continued to interact with the lucerne throughout lactation, indicating that they still found the enrichment rewarding after the nesting period had ceased. Based on these results, lucerne enrichment was considered to improve sow welfare during farrowing and lactation and reduce the number of stillborn piglets.},

We sought to determine the effect of screening for dementia in primary care practices on the formal diagnosis rate; the distribution of differential diagnoses; and the factors associated with receiving a formal diagnosis. METHODS The "Dementia: life- and person-centered help in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania" is an ongoing general practitioner (GP)-based, randomized, controlled intervention trial. A total of 4064 community dwelling patients (aged ≥70 years) were screened for dementia in 108 GP practices. Of these patients, 692 (17\%) had positive screening results (DemTect score {$<$}9). Of these 692 patients, 406 (59\%) provided informed consent. The analyses included the data from 243 patients with a complete baseline assessment (preliminary data; January 2014). RESULTS Of 146 patients without a formal diagnosis of dementia, 72 (49\%) received a formal diagnosis after a positive screening outcome (69\% with "unspecified dementia"). Female sex was significantly associated with receiving a formal diagnosis (multivariate analyses). CONCLUSION Screening improved the identification of dementia considerably. Because of the risk of receiving a false-positive diagnosis, additional diagnostic assessment should be mandatory.},

Wave 1 data on severe mental illness and risk factors were analyzed to predict wave 2 data on violent behavior.Main Outcome MeasuresReported violent acts committed between waves 1 and 2.ResultsBivariate analyses showed that the incidence of violence was higher for people with severe mental illness, but only significantly so for those with co-occurring substance abuse and/or dependence. Multivariate analyses revealed that severe mental illness alone did not predict future violence; it was associated instead with historical (past violence, juvenile detention, physical abuse, parental arrest record), clinical (substance abuse, perceived threats), dispositional (age, sex, income), and contextual (recent divorce, unemployment, victimization) factors. Most of these factors were endorsed more often by subjects with severe mental illness.ConclusionsBecause severe mental illness did not independently predict future violent behavior, these findings challenge perceptions that mental illness is a leading cause of violence in the general population. Still, people with mental illness did report violence more often, largely because they showed other factors associated with violence. Consequently, understanding the link between violent acts and mental disorder requires consideration of its association with other variables such as substance abuse, environmental stressors, and history of violence.},

  abstract = {Dispersal is one of the most important life-history traits affecting species persistence and evolution and is increasingly relevant for conservation biology as ecosystems become more fragmented. However, movement during different dispersal stages has been difficult to study and remains poorly understood. We analysed movement metrics and patterns of autocorrelation from \{GPS\} data for 20 lions over a five year period. We compared movement among different stages of natal dispersal (departure, transience and settlement) in addition to that of territorial adults of both sexes. The movement of lions differed according to dispersal stage, sex, group size and rainfall. As expected, during dispersal lions moved faster and further and in a more directional manner than pre- or post-dispersal. Transient movement was more directional than adult movement, but somewhat surprisingly, was slower with less net displacement than that of territorial males. Interestingly, the effect of group size on movement differed between transient males and territorial males; solitary dispersers moved faster and further than individuals in bigger groups, while territorial males had the opposite trend. Although our sample size is limited, our results suggest a transition from directional movement during transience to random or periodic use of a fixed territory after settlement. In addition, group size may affect the search and settlement strategies of dispersers while seeking a territory in which to settle.},

  abstract = {Reliable estimates of animal density are fundamental to our understanding of ecological processes and population dynamics. Furthermore, their accuracy is vital to conservation biology since wildlife authorities rely on these figures to make decisions. However, it is notoriously difficult to accurately estimate density for wide-ranging species such as carnivores that occur at low densities. In recent years, significant progress has been made in density estimation of Asian carnivores, but the methods have not been widely adapted to African carnivores. African lions (Panthera leo) provide an excellent example as although abundance indices have been shown to produce poor inferences, they continue to be used to estimate lion density and inform management and policy. In this study we adapt a Bayesian spatially explicit capture-recapture model to estimate lion density in the Maasai Mara National Reserve (MMNR) and surrounding conservancies in Kenya. We utilize sightings data from a three-month survey period to produce statistically rigorous spatial density estimates. Overall posterior mean lion density was estimated to be 16.85 (posterior standard deviation = 1.30) lions over one year of age per 100km 2 with a sex ratio of 2.2♀:1♂. We argue that such methods should be developed, improved and favored over less reliable methods such as track and call-up surveys. We caution against trend analyses based on surveys of differing reliability and call for a unified framework to assess lion numbers across their range in order for better informed management and policy decisions to be made.},

  abstract = {Abstract Bayesian inference is an important statistical tool that is increasingly being used by ecologists. In a Bayesian analysis, information available before a study is conducted is summarized in a quantitative model or hypothesis: the prior probability distribution. Bayes' Theorem uses the prior probability distribution and the likelihood of the data to generate a posterior probability distribution. Posterior probability distributions are an epistemological alternative to P-values and provide a direct measure of the degree of belief that can be placed on models, hypotheses, or parameter estimates. Moreover, Bayesian information-theoretic methods provide robust measures of the probability of alternative models, and multiple models can be averaged into a single model that reflects uncertainty in model construction and selection. These methods are demonstrated through a simple worked example. Ecologists are using Bayesian inference in studies that range from predicting single-species population dynamics to understanding ecosystem processes. Not all ecologists, however, appreciate the philosophical underpinnings of Bayesian inference. In particular, Bayesians and frequentists differ in their definition of probability and in their treatment of model parameters as random variables or estimates of true values. These assumptions must be addressed explicitly before deciding whether or not to use Bayesian methods to analyse ecological data.},

We measured some skull characteristics and weighed the muscles of mastication, and macroscopically observed the muscles of mastication in the two species. The noticeable differences between the two species are classified as follows: (1) The size ratio of the zygomatic width was much larger in the giant panda than in the Asiatic black bear. (2) The weight ratio of the two pterygoid muscles was also much larger in the giant panda than in the Asiatic black bear. (3) The lateral slips of the temporal muscles are thicker and stronger in the Asiatic black bear than in the giant panda. (4) The deep layer of the masseter muscle was rostrocaudally divided, and a complicated running of tendons is observed in the giant panda. (5) The two pterygoid muscles were much larger and well-developed in the giant panda than in the Asiatic black bear. The points (1) and (4) may be related to the generation of the force necessary to chew the bamboo in the giant panda. We thought that the large mass of the masseter and temporal muscles are needed in this species. In the points of (2) and (5), the two pterygoid muscles were obviously different in form and weight ratio between the two species. We suggest that the two pterygoid muscles may act as an additional force generator to dorsoventrally press and crush bamboo stems.},

  abstract = {The Australian constitution makes no mention of native animals. Responsibility for animal welfare is largely retained by the states and territories via a fragmented, complex, contradictory, inconsistent system of regulatory management. Given that most jurisdictions have expressly made the possession of wildlife unlawful, the action of taking and possessing an animal, to rehabilitate it, defies the regulatory process. In most jurisdictions, it is illegal to microchip, band, or mark an animal, meaning that no reliable method is available to monitor an animal. Each year, a minimum of 50,000 rehabilitated native animals are released back to the wild, with little post-release monitoring. Where required, the assessments of behavioural and health requirements to confirm suitability for release may be undertaken by people with either negligible or questionable qualifications. Whilst it can be appropriate to rehabilitate and release injured native animals back to the wild, there may be moral, ethical, and practical reasons for not releasing hand-reared orphan native animals. This article examines the evolution, and explains the consequences, of decentralised regulation on wildlife carers and rehabilitating animals. It recommends that the practice of placing hand-reared native animals into the wild, and the regulatory framework that provides for it, should be reviewed.},

Sixty-nine zoos, mainly from Europe but also from North America and Australia/New Zealand, responded to our survey. The results revealed that in general zoos follow the management guidelines for most of the investigated issues. The average enclosure is almost four times larger than the minimum size recommended by the management guidelines, although seven zoos have smaller enclosures. About half the zoos do not follow the guidelines concerning visitor access and number of nest boxes. Other issues that may compromise animal welfare include proximity of neighboring carnivore species and placement of nest boxes.},

  abstract = {We model the evolution of reaction norms focusing on three aspects: frequency-dependent selection arising from resource competition, maintenance and production costs of phenotypic plasticity, and three characteristics of environmental heterogeneity (frequency of environments, their intrinsic carrying capacity and the sensitivity to phenotypic maladaptation in these environments). We show that (i) reaction norms evolve so as to trade adaptation for acquiring resources against cost avoidance; (ii) maintenance costs cause reaction norms to better adapt to frequent rather than to infrequent environments, whereas production costs do not; and (iii) evolved reaction norms confer better adaptation to environments with low rather than with high intrinsic carrying capacity. The two previous findings contradict earlier theoretical results and originate from two previously unexplored features that are included in our model. First, production costs of phenotypic plasticity are only incurred when a given phenotype is actually produced. Therefore, they are proportional to the frequency of environments, and these frequencies thus affect the selection pressure to avoid costs just as much as the selection pressure to improve adaptation. This prevents the frequency of environments from affecting the evolving reaction norm. Secondly, our model describes the evolution of plasticity for a phenotype determining an individual's capability to acquire resources, and thus its realized carrying capacity. When individuals are distributed randomly across environments, they cannot avoid experiencing environments with intrinsically low carrying capacity. As selection pressures arising from the need to improve adaptation are stronger under such extreme conditions than under mild ones, better adaptation to environments with low rather than with high intrinsic carrying capacity results.},

The objective was to assess the reasons for adjustments to treatment with OAAs during the first 100~days of treatment. Methods: The authors performed a prospective observational study of cancer outpatients who initiated OAAs between November 2015 and October 2017. Dose reductions and treatment interruptions were closely followed-up during the first 100~days after the beginning of treatment with an OAA. The authors described the different safety profile of different OAA classes. Results: The authors included 443 patients (31 different OAA assessed), of whom 53.0\% required their OAA to be adjusted during the first 100~days of treatment. A total of 151 patients required dose reductions and/or interruptions of OAAs owing to AEs. The authors identified 203 AEs in these patients. Treatment with sorafenib, lower ECOG performance status, and first-line treatment were associated with a higher proportion of treatment adjustments due to AEs. Conclusion: These results in clinical practice could be a first approach to help healthcare professionals to design patient monitoring programs by identifying priority patients and drugs, and remarks the importance of pharmacovigilance in OAAs.},

Prandial insulin analogues have been developed to replicate the physiology of normal endogenous insulin secretion and action, with the aim of limiting postprandial glucose excursions. There is still, however, a significant unmet need, with many people failing to achieve desired glycaemic control targets despite the current armamentarium of prandial insulin analogues. Such insulins have a delayed onset and a longer duration of action than endogenous insulin production. There has been considerable focus on attempts to accelerate the time-action profile of prandial exogenous insulin in order to produce a more physiological profile. One such approach is to modify the insulin formulation. Fast-acting insulin aspart is a modified formulation of insulin aspart containing niacinamide and L-arginine. It has an earlier onset of action than aspart. In an extensive trial programme, this faster aspart demonstrated similar HbA1c reductions to those achieved with aspart but superior postprandial glucose reductions, with no increase in hypoglycaemia. Furthermore, administration of faster aspart up to 20~min after the start of a meal permitted similar glucose control to aspart given preprandially. These data, taken in totality, illustrate the potential role of faster insulin aspart in clinical practice.},

Over the period 1960 to 2000, international agricultural research centers, in collaboration with national research programs, contributed to the development of "modern varieties" for many crops. These varieties have contributed to large increases in crop production. Productivity gains, however, have been uneven across crops and regions. Consumers generally benefited from declines in food prices. Farmers benefited only where cost reductions exceeded price reductions.},

Arlequin 3 introduces a completely new graphical interface written in C++, a more robust semantic analysis of input files, and two new methods: a Bayesian estimation of gametic phase from multi-locus genotypes, and an estimation of the parameters of an instantaneous spatial expansion from DNA sequence polymorphism. Arlequin can handle several data types like DNA sequences, microsatellite data, or standard multi-locus genotypes.

  abstract = {Most free-choice science learning institutions, in particular science centers, zoos, aquariums, and natural history museums, define themselves as educational institutions. However, to what extent, and for which visitors, do these free-choice learning settings accomplish their educational mission? Answering this question has proven challenging, in large part because of the inherent variability of visitors to such settings. We hypothesize that the challenges of measuring free-choice science learning might be diminished if it were possible to pool populations during analysis in ways that reduced this variability. Specifically, we propose grouping learners according to their entering understanding and attitudes, using qualitative categories such as minimal, moderate, and extensive. In this article, we use data collected at the National Aquarium in Baltimore to determine whether grouping makes it possible to discern more readily the nature of changes in aquarium visitors’ conservation knowledge and attitudes. Although analysis revealed that there were significant changes in both conservation knowledge and attitudes, entry to exit, for all 100 visitors studied, a more detailed analysis revealed that gains were not evenly distributed across all visitors. The results support the hypothesis that the grouping of learners into minimal, moderate, and extensive conservation knowledge and attitude categories enabled a more fine-grained and accurate understanding of changes in aquarium visitor’s conservation learning.},

  abstract = {The mitochondrion is essential for energy metabolism and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In intact cells, respiratory mitochondria exhibit spontaneous "superoxide flashes", the quantal ROS-producing events consequential to transient mitochondrial permeability transition (tMPT). Here we perform the first in vivo imaging of mitochondrial superoxide flashes and tMPT activity in living mice expressing the superoxide biosensor mt-cpYFP, and demonstrate their coupling to whole-body glucose metabolism. Robust tMPT/superoxide flash activity occurred in skeletal muscle and sciatic nerve of anesthetized transgenic mice. In skeletal muscle, imaging tMPT/superoxide flashes revealed labyrinthine three-dimensional networks of mitochondria that operate synchronously. The tMPT/superoxide flash activity surged in response to systemic glucose challenge or insulin stimulation, in an apparently frequency-modulated manner and involving also a shift in the gating mode of tMPT. Thus, in vivo imaging of tMPT-dependent mitochondrial ROS signals and the discovery of the metabolism-tMPT-superoxide flash coupling mark important technological and conceptual advances for the study of mitochondrial function and ROS signaling in health and disease.},

  abstract = {Seven studies explored the empirical basis for claims that infants represent cardinal values of small sets of objects. Many studies investigating numerical ability did not properly control for continuous stimulus properties such as surface area, volume, contour length, or dimensions that correlate with these properties. Experiment 1 extended the standard habituation/dishabituation paradigm to a 1 vs 2 comparison with three-dimensional objects and confirmed that when number and total front surface area are confounded, infants discriminate the arrays. Experiment 2 revealed that infants dishabituated to a change in front surface area but not to a change in number when the two variables were pitted against each other. Experiments 3 through 5 revealed no sensitivity to number when front surface area was controlled, and Experiments 6 and 7 extended this pattern of findings to the Wynn (1992) transformation task. Infants' lack of a response to number, combined with their demonstrated sensitivity to one or more dimensions of continuous extent, supports the hypothesis that the representations subserving object-based attention, rather than those subserving enumeration, underlie performance in the above tasks. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

Natural samples of infant-and adult-directed speech were recorded from 5 mothers of 12-month-old infants, in 5 standardized interactional contexts: Attention-bid, Approval, Prohibition, Comfort, and Game/Telephone. 25 infant-directed and 25 adult-directed vocalizations were electronically filtered to eliminate linguistic content. The content-filtered speech stimuli were presented to 80 adult subjects: 40 experienced parents and 40 students inexperienced with infants. The subjects' task was to identify the communicative intent of the speaker using only prosodic information, given a 5-alternative forced choice. Listeners were able to use intonation to identify the speaker's intent with significantly higher accuracy in infant-directed speech than in adult-directed speech. These findings suggest that the prosodic patterns of speech to infants are more informative than those of adult-adult speech, and may provide the infant with reliable cues to the communicative intent of the speaker. The interpretation of these results proposed here is that the relation of prosodic form to communicative function is made uniquely salient in the melodies of mothers' speech, and that these characteristic prosodic patterns are potentially meaningful to the preverbal infant.},

  abstract = {Shaping through differential reinforcement of successive approximations to a target response has been a cornerstone procedure for the training of novel behavior. However, much of how it has traditionally been implemented occurs through informal observation, rather than any direct, systematic measurement. In the present study, we examine the use of response-independent food schedules and shaping for increasing approach and contact behaviors in petting zoo sheep. In Experiment 1, a fixed-time (FT) 15 s food schedule was used to effectively increase approach and contact behaviors in one sheep. In Experiment 2, negative reinforcement in the form of removal of the presence of a trainer was made contingent on the successful completion of approximations within a shaping procedure and later switched to food rewards. A changing-criterion design was used to empirically examine the effects of the shaping procedure during each step of the program. The result is one of the first studies to demonstrate the utility of using negative reinforcement within a shaping procedure to successfully intervene on approach/avoidance behaviors in an applied animal setting.},

  abstract = {Parrots kept in zoos and private households often develop psychological and behavioural disorders. Despite knowing that such disorders have a multifactorial aetiology and that chronic stress is involved, little is known about their development mainly due to a poor understanding of the parrots’ physiology and the lack of validated methods to measure stress in these species. In birds, blood corticosterone concentrations provide information about adrenocortical activity. However, blood sampling techniques are difficult, highly invasive and inappropriate to investigate stressful situations and welfare conditions. Thus, a non-invasive method to measure steroid hormones is critically needed. Aiming to perform a physiological validation of a cortisone enzyme immunoassay (EIA) to measure glucocorticoid metabolites (GCM) in droppings of 24 Blue-fronted parrots (Amazona aestiva), two experiments were designed. During the experiments all droppings were collected at 3-h intervals. Initially, birds were sampled for 24 h (experiment 1) and one week later assigned to four different treatments (experiment 2): Control (undisturbed), Saline (0.2 mL of 0.9\% NaCl IM), Dexamethasone (1 mg/kg IM) and Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH; 25 IU IM). Treatments (always one week apart) were applied to all animals in a cross-over study design. A daily rhythm pattern in GCM excretion was detected but there were no sex differences (first experiment). Saline and dexamethasone treatments had no effect on GCM (not different from control concentrations). Following ACTH injection, GCM concentration increased about 13.1-fold (median) at the peak (after 3–9 h), and then dropped to pre-treatment concentrations. By a successful physiological validation, we demonstrated the suitability of the cortisone EIA to non-invasively monitor increased adrenocortical activity, and thus, stress in the Blue-fronted parrot. This method opens up new perspectives for investigating the connection between behavioural disorders and stress in this bird species, and could also help in their captive management.},

Natural selection has crafted a mechanism involving changes in nausea susceptibility and olfactory perception that reduces meat consumption during pregnancy. Evidence is presented showing that the luteal phase is marked by both immunosuppression and changes in nausea susceptibility and olfaction; meat consumption may be reduced during this period, suggesting a mechanism similar to pregnancy sickness. Constraints on compensatory increases in meat consumption outside of the luteal phase explain why women eat less meat than men. Meat is the principal target of acquired aversions. Women possess more aversions than men, suggesting that prophylactic mechanisms sometimes result in longstanding dietary changes. Reproductive immunosuppression explains many aspects of dietary behavior and sheds light on factors that may have contributed to gender-based divisions of labor during hominid evolution.},

Are these truly effects on perception, or might some instead reflect influences on judgment, memory, or response bias? Here, we exploited an infamous art-historical reasoning error (the so-called "El Greco fallacy") to demonstrate that multiple alleged top-down effects (including effects of morality on lightness perception and effects of action capabilities on spatial perception) cannot truly be effects on perception. We suggest that this error may also contaminate several other varieties of top-down effects and that this discovery has implications for debates over the continuity (or lack thereof) of perception and cognition.},

  abstract = {Dromiciops gliroides is an arboreal marsupial found in the temperate forests of South America (36-43 °S). This species is the sole extant representative of the order Microbiotheria, and is a key seed disperser of many native plant species, including the keystone mistletoe Tristerix corymbosus. Here, we synthesized the current knowledge on the ecological aspects of this species, and compared the available information from Argentina and Chile. Population density (23\,±\,2 (mean ± SE) individual/ha) and home range (1.6\,±\,0.6~ha) appear to be relatively similar across a marked ecological gradient in the mainland, but lower densities (7\,±\,2 individual/ha) and smaller home ranges (0.26\,±\,0.04~ha) were detected at island sites. We detected regional variation in body condition in Chile, but there were no significant differences across a wider E-W gradient. Movement patterns fit a random walk model; such behavior might have important consequences in shaping plant's spatial patterns. Although our data suggest that D. gliroides is more tolerant to habitat disturbance than previously thought, its incapability to disperse across non-forested areas suggests that the rapid rate of habitat loss and fragmentation that characterizes southern temperate forests likely poses a serious threat to this species. These ecological similarities are surprising given that forests studied receive dramatically different rainfall and correspond to distinct forest types. The evidence synthetized here dispels some of the myths about this species but also stresses the need for more comprehensive ecological studies across its distribution range.},

  abstract = {Superstitious behaviours, which arise through the incorrect assignment of cause and effect, receive considerable attention in psychology and popular culture. Perhaps owing to their seeming irrationality, however, they receive little attention in evolutionary biology. Here we develop a simple model to define the condition under which natural selection will favour assigning causality between two events. This leads to an intuitive inequality--akin to an amalgam of Hamilton's rule and Pascal's wager--that shows that natural selection can favour strategies that lead to frequent errors in assessment as long as the occasional correct response carries a large fitness benefit. It follows that incorrect responses are the most common when the probability that two events are really associated is low to moderate: very strong associations are rarely incorrect, while natural selection will rarely favour making very weak associations. Extending the model to include multiple events identifies conditions under which natural selection can favour associating events that are never causally related. Specifically, limitations on assigning causal probabilities to pairs of events can favour strategies that lump non-causal associations with causal ones. We conclude that behaviours which are, or appear, superstitious are an inevitable feature of adaptive behaviour in all organisms, including ourselves.},

  abstract = {D ue originally to Nelder and Wedderburn (1972), generalized linear models are a remarkable synthesis and extension of familiar regression models such as the linear models described in Part II of this text and the logit and probit models described in the preceding chapter. The current chapter begins with a consideration of the general structure and range of application of generalized linear models; proceeds to examine in greater detail generalized linear models for count data, including contingency tables; briefly sketches the statistical theory underlying generalized linear models; and concludes with the extension of regression diagnostics to generalized linear models. The unstarred sections of this chapter are perhaps more difficult than the unstarred material in preceding chapters. Generalized linear models have become so central to effective statistical data analysis, however, that it is worth the additional effort required to acquire a basic understanding of the subject.},

  abstract = {Evidence is mounting that personality is associated with health and well-being in humans and other animals. In a step towards increasing our understanding of this link, we applied regulatory focus theory, a motivational perspective from social psychology, to the behavior of zoo-housed cotton top tamarins. We tested whether regulatory focus “personality,” that is stable differences in whether an individual is motivated by gains versus safety, would 1) produce individual differences in behavior and 2) predict how individuals interact with enrichment. First, we characterized individuals with respect to several key behaviors: eating in the open, hiding, and time spent near the front of the exhibit. The monkeys were consistent in their behavioral tendencies across the 6-month study, allowing regulatory focus classification. One monkey showed evidence of being a promotion-individual, that is, more motivated by gains than safety. One monkey showed evidence of being a prevention-individual, that is, more motivated by safety than gains. The other monkeys were stable in their behavior and showed evidence of being intermediate-individuals, that is, they favored neither gains nor safety. Using these characterizations, we predicted distinct patterns of individual-object interactions with enrichment. For example, we predicted that a promotion-individual (favoring gains over safety) would approach potential gains faster than a prevention-individual (favoring safety over gains). Counter-intuitively, however, we also predicted that a promotion-individual would approach non-gains slower than a prevention-individual concerned with safety. We found support for our predictions, which suggests that regulatory focus theory could be a useful tool for understanding how and why individuals interact with environmental enrichment.},

  abstract = {Many questions about animal welfare involve the affective states of animals (pain, fear, distress) and people look to science to clarify these issues as a basis for practices, policies and standards. However, the science of the mid twentieth century tended to be silent on matters of animal affect for both philosophical and methodological reasons. Philosophically, under the influence of Positivism many scientists considered that the affective states of animals fall outside the scope of science. Certain methodological features of the research also favoured explanations that did not involve affect. The features included the tendency to rely on abstract, quantitative measures rather than description, to use controlled experiments more than naturalistic observation, and to focus on measures of central tendency (means, medians) rather than individual differences. Much animal welfare science has dropped the philosophical stance but retained most of the methodological features. Thus, animal welfare scientists attempt to understand affect through quantitative measures, often in controlled experiments, with relatively little focus on individual differences. An alternative paradigm, seen in the work of Jane Goodall, Barbara Smuts and others, made a fundamental departure from these methodological features. These scientists collected qualitative, narrative data as well as quantitative; they described complex behaviour rather than measuring selected abstract features; and they attempted to understand the unique features of individual animals rather than averages for a species or type. Data produced by this alternative paradigm almost require scientists to involve affect in order to achieve plausible explanations of behaviour. Suitably developed, the alternative paradigm may provide a useful tool for fundamental studies relevant to animal affect and animal welfare. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Abstract Animal Welfare 1995, 4: 103-117 In conceptualizing animal welfare, it is useful to distinguish among three types of concepts. 'Type l' are single, measurable attributes. 'Type 2' are single attributes that cannot be measured directly but can be estimated by correctly combining various contributing attributes. 'Type 3' are concepts involving multiple attributes which are grouped together because they serve some common function, and whose relative importance cannot be established in an entirely objective way. Individuals who treat animal welfare as a type 1 concept may propose single, objective measures of welfare, such as longevity or levels of stress-related hormones; however, this approach rests on judgements, which are not purely objective, about the relative importance of different factors for an animal s quality of life. Studies of animal preferences and motivation are sometimes seen as an objective way to weight different attributes according to the animals' own priorities, and thus allow animal welfare to be treated as a type 2 concept. However, numerous technical and fundamental difficulties limit our ability to do this. Animal welfare is best seen as a type 3 concept incorporating multiple attributes, with considerable consensus over certain general principles (eg that a high level of welfare implies freedom from suffering) but with value-related disagreement over how these principles should be applied. Because the various attributes cannot be combined in a purely objective way, science is limited in its ability to determine the 'overall 'welfare of an animal and to compare welfare in disparate environments. Instead of attempting to mffaSure' animal welfare, the role of science should be seen as identifying, rectifying and preventing welfare problems.},

  abstract = {In debates about the welfare of animals, different people have tended to emphasize different concerns. Some emphasize the basic health and functioning of animals, especially freedom from disease and injury. Others emphasize the "affective states" of animals states like pain, distress and pleasure that are experienced as positive or negative. Others emphasize the ability of animals to live reasonably natural lives by carrying out natural behaviour and having natural elements in their environ- ment. These concerns constitute different criteria that peo- ple use to assess animal welfare. The criteria overlap substantially but are sufficiently independent that the sin- gle-minded pursuit of any one criterion may lead to poor welfare as judged by the others. The different criteria reflect different sets of values that have been in conflict since the early debates about human welfare during the Industrial Revolution, with one side valuing a simple, nat- ural life while the other values progress, productivity, and a life improved by science and technology. Scientific research on animal welfare has been based on the various criteria of welfare. Such research has helped to identify and solve animal welfare problems through improved housing and management of animals. However, the research has not resolved the differences attributable to the different criteria of animal welfare. Rather, the differ- ent criteria have provided the rationale for diverse approaches to animal welfare research. Thus, our under- standing of animal welfare is both values-based and sci- ence-based. In this respect, animal welfare is like many other topics of "mandated" science such as food safety and environmental sustainability where the tools of sci- ence are used within a framework of values.},

  abstract = {Long-term facilitation at the crayfish opener muscle is elicited by prolonged high frequency stimulation, and arises from an increase in functional active zones, resulting in increased transmitter release. LTF induction depends critically upon presynaptic calcium accumulation and calcineurin (PP2B) activity. The protein synthesis dependence of this synaptic strengthening was investigated. LTF occurred without transcription, but the translation inhibitors cycloheximide and anisomycin, or local presynaptic injection of mRNA cap analog m7GpppG, impaired LTF expression. Both MAP kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase (PI3K) activation are implicated in this rapamycin-sensitive synaptic potentiation. This study defines an important role for protein synthesis in the expression of activity-dependent plasticity, and provides mechanistic insight for the induction of this process at presynaptic sites},

  abstract = {Long-term facilitation at the crayfish opener muscle is elicited by prolonged high frequency stimulation, and arises from an increase in functional active zones, resulting in increased transmitter release. LTF induction depends critically upon presynaptic calcium accumulation and calcineurin (PP2B) activity. The protein synthesis dependence of this synaptic strengthening was investigated. LTF occurred without transcription, but the translation inhibitors cycloheximide and anisomycin, or local presynaptic injection of mRNA cap analog m7GpppG, impaired LTF expression. Both MAP kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase (PI3K) activation are implicated in this rapamycin-sensitive synaptic potentiation. This study defines an important role for protein synthesis in the expression of activity-dependent plasticity, and provides mechanistic insight for the induction of this process at presynaptic sites},

  abstract = {The present study\&rsquo;s aim was to assess the test\&minus;retest reliability (TRR) of the \&lsquo;Welfare Quality\&reg; animal welfare assessment protocol for sows and piglets\&rsquo; focusing on the welfare principle \&lsquo;appropriate behavior\&rsquo;. TRR was calculated using Spearman\&rsquo;s rank correlation coefficient (RS), intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), smallest detectable change (SDC), and limits of agreement (LoA). Principal component analysis (PCA) was used for deeper analysis of the Qualitative Behavior Assessment (QBA). The study was conducted on thirteen farms in Northern Germany, which were visited five times by the same observer. Farm visits 1 (F1; day 0) were compared to farm visits 2 to 5 (F2\&ndash;F5). The QBA indicated no TRR when applying the statistical parameters introduced above (e.g., \&lsquo;playful\&lsquo; (F1\&ndash;F4) RS 0.08 ICC 0.00 SDC 0.50 LoA [\&minus;0.62, 0.38]). The PCA detected contradictory TRR. Acceptable TRR could be found for parts of the instantaneous scan sampling (e.g., negative social behavior (F1\&ndash;F3) RS 0.45 ICC 0.37 SDC 0.02 LoA [\&minus;0.03, 0.02]). The human\&minus;animal relationship test solely achieved poor TRR, whereas scans for stereotypies showed sufficient TRR (e.g., floor licking (F1\&ndash;F4) RS 0.63 ICC 0.52 SDC 0.05 LoA [\&minus;0.08, 0.04]). Concluding, the principle \&lsquo;appropriate behavior\&rsquo; does not represent TRR and further investigation is needed before implementation on-farm.},

The effect of primary production is controlled for by using two environmental factors, rainfall and soil nutrient availability, and the effect of species richness of the ungulate community is evaluated. The results confirm the dominant effect of rainfall, and demonstrate that soil nutrient levels also strongly affect the biomass of large ungulate communities. For a given level of rainfall, on rich soils (high nutrient availability) the biomass of large ungulates is about 20 times as great as on poor soils with low nutrient availability. The model based on rainfall and soil nutrient classes accounts for 87\% of the variance in large ungulate biomass. Pastoral and natural ecosystems do not differ significantly in large ungulate biomass; there is therefore currently no evidence that extensive pastoral management increases carrying capacity for large ungulates above the levels observed in natural communities. Species richness, a measure of biodiversity, had a significant but very small effect on the biomass-rainfall relation in the complete data set. When analysed by pastoral management, the effect of this factor was significant for the set of natural ecosystems only. Pastoral management and species richness may therefore have compensatory effects. These results suggest that the carrying capacity is limited at the community, rather than the species, level.},

Rainbow trout (Onchorhyncus mykiss) were given emboldening or negative experiences in the forms of watching bold or shy individuals responding to novelty or winning or losing fights to examine whether prior experience affected boldness. Bold individuals that lost fights or watched shy demonstrators became more shy by increasing their latency to approach a novel object, whereas shy observers that watched bold demonstrators remained cautious and did not modify their responses to novelty. Shy winners became bolder and decreased their latency to approach a novel object, but shy losers also displayed this shift. In comparison, control groups showed no change in behaviour. Bold fishes given negative experiences reduced their boldness which may be an adaptive response; however, shy fishes may base their strategic decisions upon self-assessment of their relative competitive ability and increase their boldness in situations where getting to resources more quickly ensures they outcompete better competitors.},

The conceptual core of this body of theory is the functional response, predicting the rate of prey consumption by individual predators as a function of predator and/or prey densities. This assumption is seriously violated in many ecosystems in which predators and/or prey form social groups. Here we develop a new set of group-dependent functional responses to consider the ecological implications of sociality and apply the model to the Serengeti ecosystem. All of the prey species typically captured by Serengeti lions (Panthera leo) are gregarious, exhibiting nonlinear relationships between prey-group density and population density. The observed patterns of group formation profoundly reduce food intake rates below the levels expected under random mixing, having as strong an impact on intake rates as the seasonal migratory behaviour of the herbivores. A dynamical system model parameterized for the Serengeti ecosystem (using wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) as a well-studied example) shows that grouping strongly stabilizes interactions between lions and wildebeest. Our results suggest that social groups rather than individuals are the basic building blocks around which predator-prey interactions should be modelled and that group formation may provide the underlying stability of many ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Interest in personality is growing in a wide range of disciplines, but only in a few systems it is possible to assess the survival value of personality. Field studies looking at the relationship between personality and sur- vival value early in life are greatly hampered by the fact that personality can at present only be assessed after individuals become independent from their parents. In passerines, for example, this is often after a period of intensive selection for the survival on fledglings. The main aim of this study is therefore to develop a method to measure personality before this period of selection. For this purpose, we developed the handling stress (HS) test. We measured HS in 14-d-old great tit nestlings by counting the number of breast movements (breath rate) in four subse- quent 15-s bouts for 1 min; before and after they were socially isolated from their siblings for 15 min. To calculate the repeatability of HS, we repeated the test 6 mo later. To assess the relationship between HS and exploratory behaviour, we correlated the outcome of both tests. We ran tests both on birds of lines selected for extreme personality and on wild birds from a natural population. We found that birds selected for fast exploration reacted more to HS compared with birds selected for slow exploration and that HS was repeatable in different life phases. We con- firmed this by finding an increase in the HS with increasing exploratory scores in wild birds. These results show that we can use the HS test as a measurement of personality, making it a potential tool for studying the relationship between personality and survival value early in life.},

  abstract = {Recent and long-term sympatries between humans and nonhuman primates (hereafter primates) are central to the behavioral ecology, conservation, and evolutionary trajectories of numerous primate species. Ethnoprimatology emphasizes that interconnections between humans and primates should be viewed as more than just disruptions of a "natural" state, and instead anthropogenic contexts must be considered as potential drivers for specific primate behavioral patterns. Rather than focusing solely on the behavior and ecology of the primate species at hand, as in traditional primatology, or on the symbolic meanings and uses of primates, as in socio-cultural anthropology, ethnoprimatology attempts to merge these perspectives into a more integrative approach. As human pressures on environments continue to increase and primate habitats become smaller and more fragmented, the need for a primatology that considers the impact of human attitudes and behavior on all aspects of primate lives and survival is imperative. In this special issue, we present both data-driven examples and more general discussions that describe how ethnoprimatological approaches can be both a contribution to the core theory and practice of primatology and a powerful tool in our goal of conservation action.},

The present article introduces a specific approach within the accuracy paradigm called the Realistic Accuracy Model (RAM). RAM begins with the assumption that personality traits are real attributes of individuals. This assumption entails the use of a broad array of criteria for the evaluation of personality judgment and leads to a model that describes accuracy as a function of the availability, detection, and utilization of relevant behavioral cues. RAM provides a common explanation for basic moderators of accuracy, sheds light on how these moderators interact, and outlines a research agenda that includes the reintegration of the study of error with the study of accuracy.},

They were also described by two close acquaintances and by two "strangers" who knew them only via a single, spontaneous interaction viewed on videotape. The effect of acquaintanceship was powerful: Judgments by close acquaintances agreed with each other and with subjects' self-judgments much better than did judgments by strangers, even though strangers' judgments agreed with each other and with subjects' self-judgments beyond a chance level. This result implies that agreement among acquaintances' judgments must derive at least partly from experience with and observation of the person who is judged. The same traits that yielded better agreement among acquaintances also yielded better agreement among strangers and tended to be rated higher in subjective visibility, suggesting that people are intuitively knowledgeable about the traits they can judge with more and less agreement.},

It was predicted that there would be a main effect for music and an interaction effect with introverts performing less well in the presence of music than extraverts . Ten introverts and ten extraverts were given two tests (a memory test with immediate and delayed recall and a reading comprehension test) , which were completed , either while being exposed to pop music , or in silence . The results showed that there was a detrimental effect on immediate recall on the memory test for both groups when music was played , and two of the three interactions were significant . After a 6 - minute interval the introverts who had memorized the objects in the presence of the pop music had a significantly lower recall than the extraverts in the same condition and the introverts who had observed them in silence . The introverts who completed a reading comprehension task when music was being played also performed significantly less well than these two groups . These findings have implications for the study habits of introverts when needing to retain or process complex information .},

Sexually mature, adult male and female deer mice that were derived from either a mainland population (P. m. artemisiae) or an island population (P. m. angustus) were required to learn the spatial position of a hidden, submerged platform in a water maze. Deer mice were tested either during the breeding season (summer; long day photoperiod) or during the non-breeding season (winter; short day photoperiod) with a total of six blocks of four trials conducted in a single day. Retention was tested with two probe trials which occurred one and three days after acquisition. During the breeding season male spatial task acquisition was superior to female spatial task acquisition for both populations. In contrast, during the non-breeding season there were no significant sex differences in spatial acquisition for either population. This change in sexually dimorphic spatial learning was due to female spatial-performance decreasing from non-breeding season to the breeding season and male spatial-performance increasing over the same period. Both populations displayed similar seasonal variations in sexually dimorphic water-maze task performance. There were, however, overall population differences in water-maze task performance that were related to the ecology of the mice, with the insular mice displaying shorter latencies to reach the hidden platform than did the mainland deer mice.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

  abstract = {Personality traits, such as exploration-avoidance, are expected to be adaptive in a given context (e.g. low-risk environment) but to be maladaptive in others (e.g. high-risk environment). Therefore, it is expected that personality traits are flexible and respond to environmental fluctuations, given that consistency across different contexts is maintained, so that the relative individual responses in relation to others remains the same (i.e. although the magnitude of the response varies the differences between high and low responders are kept). Here, we tested the response of male cichlid fish (Oreochromis mossambicus) to a novel object (NO) in three different social contexts: (i) social isolation, (ii) in the presence of an unfamiliar conspecific, and (iii) in the presence of a familiar conspecific. Males in the familiar treatment exhibited more exploratory behaviour and less neophobia than males in either the unfamiliar or the social isolation treatments. However, there were no overall correlations in individual behaviour across the three treatments, suggesting a lack of consistency in exploration-avoidance as measured by the NO test in this species. Moreover, there were no differences in cortisol responsiveness to an acute stressor between the three treatments. Together, these results illustrate how behavioural traits usually taken as measures of personality may exhibit significant flexibility and lack the expected consistency across different social contexts.},

At the industry level, flows are higher in months with more advertising dollars spent, even for non-advertising families. At the family level, flows have a convex relation with advertising expenditures, similar to that for performance, with a significant positive effect for high relative advertisers only. At the individual fund level, advertising stems redemptions rather than increasing purchases of fund shares. We further find that advertising can affect the funds flow-performance sensitivity, dampening it for poorly performing funds and increasing it for highly performing funds.},

Collectively, research examines a range of retail contexts, focuses on many different dimensions, and, uses different methods to explore the phenomena of background music in commercial settings. Therefore, conclusions are difficult on the extent to which the influences of background music on customer behavior are generalizable. The purpose of this study is to synthesize the results of extant research to identify common effects and the circumstances under which they differ. Our meta-analysis uses a sample size of 148, taken from 32 studies.

This study assessed personality in snow leopards (Uncia uncia) by examining their reactions to six novel objects and comparing them to personality assessments based on a survey completed by zookeepers. The objectives were to determine whether these methods could detect differences in personality, including age and sex differences, and to assess whether the two methods yielded comparable results. Both keeper assessments and novel object tests identified age, sex, and individual differences in snow leopards. Five dimensions of personality were found based on keepers' ratings: Active/Vigilant, Curious/Playful, Calm/Self-Assured, Timid/Anxious, and Friendly to Humans. The dimension Active/Vigilant was significantly positively correlated with the number of visits to the object, time spent locomoting, and time spent in exploratory behaviors. Curious/Playful was significantly positively correlated with the number of visits to the object, time spent locomoting, and time spent in exploratory behaviors. However, other dimensions (Calm/Self-Assured, Friendly to Humans, and Timid/Anxious) did not correlate with novel-object test variables and possible explanations for this are discussed. Thus, some of the traits and behaviors were correlated between assessment methods, showing the novel-object test to be useful in assessing an animal's personality should a keeper be unable to, or to support a keeper's assessment.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Black widow spiders are infamous for their neurotoxic venom, which can cause extreme and long-lasting pain. This unusual venom is dominated by latrotoxins and latrodectins, two protein families virtually unknown outside of the black widow genus Latrodectus, that are difficult to study given the paucity of spider genomes. Using tissue-, sex- and stage-specific expression data, we analyzed the recently sequenced genome of the house spider (Parasteatoda tepidariorum), a close relative of black widows, to investigate latrotoxin and latrodectin diversity, expression and evolution. RESULTS We discovered at least 47 latrotoxin genes in the house spider genome, many of which are tandem-arrayed. Latrotoxins vary extensively in predicted structural domains and expression, implying their significant functional diversification. Phylogenetic analyses show latrotoxins have substantially duplicated after the Latrodectus/Parasteatoda split and that they are also related to proteins found in endosymbiotic bacteria. Latrodectin genes are less numerous than latrotoxins, but analyses show their recruitment for venom function from neuropeptide hormone genes following duplication, inversion and domain truncation. While latrodectins and other peptides are highly expressed in house spider and black widow venom glands, latrotoxins account for a far smaller percentage of house spider venom gland expression. CONCLUSIONS The house spider genome sequence provides novel insights into the evolution of venom toxins once considered unique to black widows. Our results greatly expand the size of the latrotoxin gene family, reinforce its narrow phylogenetic distribution, and provide additional evidence for the lateral transfer of latrotoxins between spiders and bacterial endosymbionts. Moreover, we strengthen the evidence for the evolution of latrodectin venom genes from the ecdysozoan Ion Transport Peptide (ITP)/Crustacean Hyperglycemic Hormone (CHH) neuropeptide superfamily. The lower expression of latrotoxins in house spiders relative to black widows, along with the absence of a vertebrate-targeting α-latrotoxin gene in the house spider genome, may account for the extreme potency of black widow venom.},

We present a technique developed specifically for resolving an optimized dominance order of individuals in systems with transitive (i.e. linear) dominance relationships, but where not all relationships are known. Our method augments the widely used I\&SI method (de Vries, 1998) with an interpolation function for resolving the relative ranks of individuals with unknown relationships. Our method offers several advantages over other dominance methods by enabling the incorporation of any proportion of unknown relationships, resolving a unique solution to any dominance matrix, and calculating cardinal dominance strengths for each individual. As such, this method enables novel insight into difficult to study behavioural systems.},

Issues of accuracy and illusion are covered in this section. Another part of this chapter focuses on how motivation affects overt action, or acting on and in the world. The general areas of research reviewed in this section include work on intrinsic and extrinsic motivational orientations, and on issues of motivational arousal, effort expenditure, and task persistence. The final section contains a selective review of motivational thinking in the research on coming to terms with self and the end of self.},

  abstract = {The study of habitat selection usually compares assessments of habitat use to habitat availability. To investigate habitat selection of large mammals today, researchers must choose between a few very expensive Global Positioning System (GPS) telemetry collars that can provide many locations and several inexpensive very high frequency telemetry collars that will provide few numbers of locations (unless substantial resources are spent in the field). We investigated the effects of number of locations and sampled animals on the outcome of habitat-selection analyses. We evaluated whether tracking frequency and sample size of individuals influenced our ability to detect habitat selection. We used data obtained from adult female moose fitted with GPS collars to generate data sets simulating various sampling frequencies and sample sizes of individuals. Tracking schedules conformed to those commonly used in ungulate telemetry studies (1 location every 14, 7, or 3 d and 1 or 3 locations per d) as did animal sample sizes (between 8 and 20 individuals). We determined habitat use and availability at the landscape and home-range scales during summer-autumn and winter. Precision of habitat use and availability estimates did not improve markedly with increasing tracking frequency. Only results obtained with the least-intensive tracking schedule (1 location every 14 d) differed from those obtained with the other schedules and only in 25\% of the cases. Above this threshold in tracking frequency, number of sampled animals was clearly more important than number of locations in detection of habitat selection. Our results indicated that habitat-selection analyses were more sensitive to inter- than intra-individual variability. Depending on study objectives, it may be more profitable to prioritize number of sampled individuals rather than number of locations per individual. We suggest methods allowing researchers to assess inter-individual variability while studying habitat selection},

  abstract = {Hailed as a landmark in the development of experimental methods when it appeared in 1975, Design and Analysis of Time-Series Experiments is available again after several years of being out of print. Gene V Glass, Victor L. Willson and John M. Gottman have carried forward the design and analysis of perhaps the most powerful and useful quasi-experimental design identified by their mentors in the classic Campbell \& Stanley text Experimental and Quasi-experimental Design for Research (1966). In an era when governments seek to resolve questions of experimental validity by fiat and the label "Scientifically Based Research" is appropriated for only certain privileged experimental designs, nothing could be more appropriate than to bring back the classic text that challenges doctrinaire opinions of proper causal analysis. Glass, Willson \& Gottman introduce and illustrate an armamentarium of interrupted time-series experimental designs that offer some of the most powerful tools for discovering and validating causal relationships in social and education policy analysis. Drawing on the ground-breaking statistical analytic tools of Box \& Jenkins, the authors extend the comprehensive autoregressive-integrated-movingaverages (ARIMA) model to accommodate significance testing and estimation of the effects of interventions into real world time-series. Designs and full statistical analyses are richly illustrated with actual examples from education, behavioral psychology, and sociology.},

  abstract = {Though central to the sometimes injurious behaviors of REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), the dreams and nightmares experienced by these patients remain largely unstudied. The present work applies the Typical Dreams Questionnaire (TDQ) to assess several aspects of the content and recall of dreams and nightmares among large cohorts of RBD patients and matched controls. Sixty-eight polysomnographically diagnosed RBD patients (49 men; 63.7 ± 10.9 y.o.) and 44 healthy controls (28 men; 62.0 ± 12.2 y.o.) completed the 56-item TDQ and a night of polysomnography. Phasic EMG\% in REM sleep and tonic REM sleep\% were both assessed. Patients reported remembering nightmares in a typical month almost 5 times more often (3.96) than did controls (0.68) and also recalling more dreams in a month (2.3) than did controls (1.6). More RBD patients reported clinically significant nightmare frequencies than did controls and female RBD patients reported higher dream theme diversity scores than either female controls or male patients. Group main effects for TDQ theme factors pinpointed that RBD patients dreamed more of Disasters, Snakes-Insects, Paralysis-Presence, and Beasts. Patients with the highest levels of tonic EMG\% during REM sleep reported remembering fewer dreams (r = −0.377, p {$<$} .01), whereas controls with the highest levels of phasic events reported recalling more dreams (r = .491, p {$<$} .01). The typical content of patients’ dreams reflects threats posed by a variety of external agents, with some differences for men and women patients. RBD patients’ most frequently reported themes could reflect a lack of perceived control within the dream and could mirror their well-documented day-time passivity and lack of aggressiveness.

One of the most important legal documents regulating the rules of maintaining pigs is the Directive 2008/120/EC, which states that group-housed pigs should have access to litter or other materials that provide exploration and occupation. Released in 2016, the Commission Recommendation (EU) 2016/336 on the application of the Council Directive 2008/120/EC characterizes the various categories of materials that may be used to improve animal welfare. According to the document, straw is considered as an optimal material for pig housing, however, materials categorized as suboptimal (e.g., wood bark) and materials of marginal interest (e.g., plastic toys) are often used in practice and scientific research. As such, the aim of this paper is to review and systematize the current state of knowledge on the topic of the impact of environmental enrichment on pig welfare. This article raises mainly issues, such as the effectiveness of the use of various enrichment on the reduction of undesirable behavior\&mdash;tail biting; aggression; and stereotypies at the pre-weaning, post-weaning, and fattening stage of pig production.},

This study estimates the respective predictive ability by employing numerical and graphical measures.

Other techniques include exit-entry screening, formal surveillance by paid or volunteer security personnel, target removal, property marking, and removal of inducements such as graffiti. Further approaches include rule setting, education, publicity, punishment, counseling of perpetrators, efforts to increase a sense of involvement and ownership of potential vandalism targets, and procedures to improve the organizational climate. Definitive data are not available regarding the specific tactics that are the most effective, but the complexity of causes indicates the need for combinations of interventions. The need for person-environment targeting, multiple levels of intervention, and multichannel interventions also mean that a variety of persons and agencies may be offering parts of an intervention combination and underscore the need for coordination of efforts.},

It is not known whether this effect is mediated directly or indirectly by correcting the underlying pathology. Genetics may also influence the drug effect. Polymorphisms of the MAOA (monoamine oxidase A) gene interact with fluoxetine to influence metabolic profiles in juvenile monkeys. Juvenile nonhuman primates provide an appropriate model for studying fluoxetine effects and drug∗gene interactions in children. Male rhesus monkeys 1-3 years of age living in permanent social pairs were treated daily with a therapeutic dose of fluoxetine or vehicle (n = 16/group). Both members of each social pair were assigned to the same treatment group. They were observed for social interactions with their familiar cagemate over a 2-year dosing period. Subjects were genotyped for MAOA variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) polymorphisms categorized for high or low transcription rates (hi-MAOA, low-MAOA). Fluoxetine-treated animals spent 30\% more time in social interaction than vehicle controls. Fluoxetine significantly increased the duration of quiet interactions, the most common type of interaction, and also of immature sexual behavior typical of rhesus in this age group. Specific behaviors affected depended on MAOA genotype of the animal and its social partner. When given fluoxetine, hi-MOAO monkeys had more social invitation and initiation behaviors and low-MAOA subjects with low-MAOA partners had more grooming and an increased frequency of some facial and vocal expressive behaviors. Fluoxetine may facilitate social interaction in children independent of remediation of psychopathology. Common genetic variants may modify this effect.},

Although HTC has decreased over the past century, it will likely increase if current and proposed conservation initiatives to double tiger populations are successful. Increased HTC could undermine successful conservation initiatives if proactive steps are not taken to reduce HTC. The present paper provides a review of the impacts of HTC and the measures taken to reduce it in ways that reduce negative impacts on both humans and tigers, and stresses the need for development and implementation of comprehensive plans to reduce HTC.},

  abstract = {Behavioural assessments of shelter dogs ( Canis lupus familiaris ) typically comprise standardized test batteries conducted at one time point, but test batteries have shown inconsistent predictive validity. Longitudinal behavioural assessments offer an alternative. We modelled longitudinal observational data on shelter dog behaviour using the framework of behavioural reaction norms, partitioning variance into personality (i.e. inter-individual differences in behaviour), plasticity (i.e. inter-individual differences in average behaviour) and predictability (i.e. individual differences in residual intra-individual variation). We analysed data on interactions of 3263 dogs ( n = 19 281) with unfamiliar people during their first month after arrival at the shelter. Accounting for personality, plasticity (linear and quadratic trends) and predictability improved the predictive accuracy of the analyses compared to models quantifying personality and/or plasticity only. While dogs were, on average, highly sociable with unfamiliar people and sociability increased over days since arrival, group averages were unrepresentative of all dogs and predictions made at the individual level entailed considerable uncertainty. Effects of demographic variables (e.g. age) on personality, plasticity and predictability were observed. Behavioural repeatability was higher one week after arrival compared to arrival day. Our results highlight the value of longitudinal assessments on shelter dogs and identify measures that could improve the predictive validity of behavioural assessments in shelters.},

Students consistently demonstrated a shift from a dualistic to a more complex understanding of ideas, relationships, and the natural world. This widening perception and moral awareness occurred in tandem with course content learning. In this paper we describe the model that emerged from our data to describe this shift from dualism to complexity – from self-awareness, to social learning, to curriculum engagement, to a wider moral community – and the factors that facilitate each step. We also provide a planning and assessment tool to help other educators begin to observe ethical development and relational growth in their own interdisciplinary environmental field classes.},

  abstract = {Background The long-term success of ex-situ conservation programmes depends on species-appropriate husbandry and enrichment practices complemented by an accurate welfare assessment protocol. Zoos and conservation breeding programmes should employ a bottom-up approach to account for intraspecific variations in measures of animal welfare. We studied 35 (14:21) captive Asiatic lions in Sakkarbaug Zoological Garden, Junagadh, India to understand the implications of individual variations on welfare measures. We categorized the subjects based on personality traits (bold or shy), rearing history (wild-rescued or captive-raised), sex, and social-grouping. We explored the association of these categorical variables on welfare indices such as behavioural diversity, latency to approach novel objects, enclosure usage and aberrant repetitive behaviours. Further, we assessed the inter-relationships between different behavioural measures of welfare. Results Our results show that intraspecific variations based on rearing-history and personality traits are significantly associated with the welfare states of captive Asiatic lions. Asiatic lions with bold personality traits (M = 0.50, SD = 0.12, N = 21) and those raised in captivity (M = 0.47, SD = 0.12, N = 16) used enclosure space more homogenously compared to shy (M = 0.71, SD = 0.15, N = 14) and wild-rescued (M = 0.67, SD = 0.15, N = 19) animals. Behaviour diversity was significantly higher in captive-raised (M = 1.26, SD = 0.3, N = 16) and bold (M = 1.23, SD = 0.26, N = 21) subjects compared to wild-rescued (M = 0.83, SD = 0.35, N = 19) and shy (M = 0.73, SD = 0.34, N = 14) individuals. Aberrant repetitive behaviours (stereotypy) were significantly lower in bold (M = 7.01, SD = 4, N = 21) and captive-raised (M = 7.74, SD = 5.3) individuals compared to wild-rescued (M = 13.12, SD = 6.25, N = 19) and shy (M = 16.13, SD = 5.4, N = 16) lions. Sex and social-grouping of subjects did not show significant associations with behavioural welfare indices. Interestingly, behaviour diversity was reliably predicted by the enclosure usage patterns and aberrant repetitive behaviours displayed by subjects. Discussion Our findings underline the importance of individual-centric, behaviour-based, and multi-dimensional welfare assessment approaches in ex-situ conservation programmes. The results suggest that behavioural welfare indices complemented with individual variations can explain inter-individual differences in behavioural welfare measure outcomes of Asiatic lions. These findings also provide zoo managers with a non-invasive tool to reliably assess and improve husbandry practices for Asiatic lions. Understanding the unique welfare requirement of individuals in captivity will be crucial for the survival of the species.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}The endangered Asiatic lion (Panthera leo persica) is currently distributed as a single wild population of 670 individuals and \textasciitilde 400 captive animals globally. Although the captive lions are major hope for the species long-term conservation through repatriation, their welfare status and management practises need research attention. To this end, we tested the efficacy of feeding, sensory and manipulable enrichment interventions on the welfare of Asiatic lions at the conservation breeding centre of Sakkarbaug Zoological Garden, Gujarat. We adopted a holistic approach by measuring physiological and behavioural responses of 35 captive Asiatic lions, divided into control (n=16) and test (n=19) groups. The test subjects approached feeding devices first and manipulable devices for a longer duration. Manipulable devices were used homogenously with two significant time peaks, but sensory devices were used sporadically throughout the day with no discernible peak usage. The control subjects remained unchanged in all welfare parameters compared to their pre-treatment levels. However, post-enrichment behavioural assessments showed higher behaviour diversity (95\% increase from the baseline period), reduced enclosure zone bias (40.25\% reduction) and aberrant repetitive behaviours (80.68\%) in test samples. Similarly, faecal corticosterone measures showed lower stress levels in test samples (58\% decrease), confirming significant improvement in all welfare indices than control groups. These results have universal applicability to assess welfare indices of other captive species in Indian zoos. We hope that the results will encourage zoo managers and regulatory agencies to improve animal welfare practices.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Ageing is a plastic process and can be successfully modulated by some biomedical approaches or pharmaceutics. In this manner it is possible to delay or even prevent some age-related pathologies. There are some defined interventions, which give promising results in animal models or even in human studies, resulting in lifespan elongation or healthspan improvement. One of the most promising targets for anti-ageing approaches are proteins belonging to the sirtuin family. Sirtuins were originally discovered as transcription repressors in yeast, however, nowadays they are known to occur in bacteria and eukaryotes (including mammals). In humans the family consists of seven members (SIRT1-7) that possess either mono-ADP ribosyltransferase or deacetylase activity. It is believed that sirtuins play key role during cell response to a variety of stresses, such as oxidative or genotoxic stress and are crucial for cell metabolism. Although some data put in question direct involvement of sirtuins in extending human lifespan, it was documented that proper lifestyle including physical activity and diet can influence healthspan via increasing the level of sirtuins. The search for an activator of sirtuins is one of the most extensive and robust topic of research. Some hopes are put on natural compounds, including curcumin. In this review we summarize the involvement and usefulness of sirtuins in anti-ageing interventions and discuss the potential role of curcumin in sirtuins regulation.},

Most urinary radioactivity was detected in the first sample collected at 3.9 2 2.5 hr postinjection and accounted for 13.9 -+ 2.1\% of the total radioac- tivity recovered. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) detected four urinary metabolites, one of which (13.7\% urinary radioactivity) eluted with the 3H-cortisol reference tracer and was quantifiable using a commercial cortisol radioimmunoassay (RIA). The majority of cortisol metabolites in feces (85.9 -+ 2.1\%) was excreted at 22.3 -+ 6.2 hr. HPLC analysis detected several fecal metabolites consisting primarily of nonhydolyzable water-soluble forms, none of which eluted with 3H-cortisol or 3H-corticosterone reference tracers. No immu- noreactivity was detected in HPLC-separated fecal eluates using the cortisol RIA; however, two of the more polar metabolites were quantifiable using a commerical cortisosterone RIA. The physiological rclcvance of the immunoreactive fecal metabolites was determined in four domestic cats given an adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) challenge. Increased serum cortisol concentrations were detected within 30 min of ACTH injection, which was maintained for at least 6 hr. A correspond- ing increase in fecal cortisol metabolite concentrations (ranging from 238\% to 826\% over individual baseline values) was observed 24-48 hr later. These data indicate that adrenocortical activity can be monitored nonivasively in the cat by measuring cortisol metabolites excreted in feces. This procedure is a potentially valuable tool for endangered felid management to help evaluate responses to physiological and psychological stressors associated with environmental condi- tions and husbandry practices.},

  abstract = {Despite publication of many well-argued critiques of null hypothesis testing (NHT), behavioral science researchers continue to rely heavily on this set of practices. Although we agree with most critics' catalogs of NHT's flaws, this article also takes the unusual stance of identifying virtues that may explain why NHT continues to be so extensively used. These virtues include providing results in the form of a dichotomous (yes/no) hypothesis evaluation and providing an index ( p value) that has a justifiable mapping onto confidence in repeatability of a null hypothesis rejection. The most-criticized flaws of NHT can be avoided when the importance of a hypothesis, rather than the p value of its test, is used to determine that a finding is worthy of report, and when p {$<$} .05 is treated as insufficient basis for confidence in the replicability of an isolated non-null finding. Together with many recent critics of NHT, we also urge reporting of important hypothesis tests in enough descriptive detail to permit secondary uses such as meta-analysis.},

As a result, input from overlapping fields, such as animal behaviour, is underused in conservation management despite its demonstrated utility as a conservation tool and countless papers advocating its use. Communication and collaboration across these two disciplines are unlikely to improve without clearly identified management needs and demonstrable impacts of behavioural-based conservation management. To facilitate this process, a team of wildlife managers and animal behaviour researchers conducted a research prioritisation exercise, identifying 50 key questions that have great potential to resolve critical conservation and management problems. The resulting agenda highlights the diversity and extent of advances that both fields could achieve through collaboration.},

There have recently been calls to apply the same adaptive framework to interindividual differences in cognition. These calls have culminated in the suggestion that variation in personality and cognition should correlate. We suggest that both these appealing notions are conceptually and logistically problematic. We identify the first crucial step for establishing any cognition-personality relationship. This is to determine the degree to which cognitive abilities yield consistent task performance. We then suggest how to establish whether such consistency exists. Finally, we discuss why formulating predictions about how cognition might be related to personality is much more difficult than is currently realised.},

  abstract = {Blank cartridges provide the power source for the majority of captive bolt devices used for rendering animals unconscious prior to slaughter within the United Kingdom or euthanasia worldwide. This paper presents the results of the examination of cartridges as one of the variables that can contribute to an unsuccessful application of this method in practice. Variation was found in cartridge weight, propellant fill volume and velocity within boxes of 1000 cartridges. The variation found was greater in lower charge (1.00 grain) cartridges than in 3.00 grain cartridges, however velocity was found to be variable in both sets. For example, in vivo velocity measurements with 0.25\&Prime; calibre 3.00 grain cartridges demonstrated an average velocity of 50.8 m/s over 200 shots with a range of 35.7 to 62.9 m/s when used in the same device. This work demonstrates that variation in cartridge performance does occur and can be due to various factors such as fill volume and propellant function, and simply weighing cartridges cannot be used to determine function, therefore cartridge performance must be a factor that is considered in the event of a miss-stun.},

Unfortunately, due to various factors this is not always the case. This paper examined, as an initial proof of concept, 12 bovine heads which had received more than one shot from a penetrating captive bolt, collected from various abattoirs within the United Kingdom. The heads were frozen to facilitate splitting on the medial plane to prevent distortion of soft tissue and each sagittal section was examined macroscopically to ascertain if this method could be used to determine the reasons for repeated stun attempts. In 10 out of 12 heads, shot placement was the determining factor, in one other head it was felt that anatomical variation was the reason and the twelfth head demonstrated signs of gun malfunction as the likely cause. This work provides evidence for a larger trial to facilitate the production of guidance for the abattoir industry, the Animal Welfare Officer and regulators on the examination of heads as part of an investigation of failures of a mechanical stunning system and to provide training material for slaughter staff tasked with effectively stunning cattle.},

  abstract = {Borrelia burgdorferi, the vector-borne bacterium that causes Lyme disease, was first identified in 1982. It is known that much of the pathology associated with Lyme borreliosis is due to the spirochete's ability to infect, colonize, disseminate, and survive within the vertebrate host. Early studies aimed at defining the biological contributions of individual genes during infection and transmission were hindered by the lack of adequate tools and techniques for molecular genetic analysis of the spirochete. The development of genetic manipulation techniques, paired with elucidation and annotation of the B. burgdorferi genome sequence, has led to major advancements in our understanding of the virulence factors and the molecular events associated with Lyme disease. Since the dawn of this genetic era of Lyme research, genes required for vector or host adaptation have garnered significant attention and highlighted the central role that these components play in the enzootic cycle of this pathogen. This chapter covers the progress made in the Borrelia field since the application of mutagenesis techniques and how they have allowed researchers to begin ascribing roles to individual genes. Understanding the complex process of adaptation and survival as the spirochete cycles between the tick vector and vertebrate host will lead to the development of more effective diagnostic tools as well as identification of novel therapeutic and vaccine targets. In this chapter, the Borrelia genes are presented in the context of their general biological roles in global gene regulation, motility, cell processes, immune evasion, and colonization/dissemination.},

  abstract = {The deer mouse presents with spontaneous stereotypic movements that resemble the repetitive behaviours of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and demonstrates a selective response to serotonin reuptake inhibitors. OCD has been linked to altered redox status and since increased dopamine signalling can promote stereotypies as well as oxidative stress, we investigated whether the severity of deer mouse stereotypy may be associated with altered dopamine turnover and cortico-striatal redox status. Deer mice were separated into high (HSB), low (LSB) and non-stereotypy (NS) groups. Frontal cortical and striatal dopamine, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA), as well as superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, reduced (GSH) and oxidised (GSSG) glutathione and glutathione redox index, were analysed as markers for regional dopamine turnover and oxidative stress, respectively. Dopamine and its metabolites and SOD activity did not differ across the stereotypy groups. Significantly reduced GSH and GSSG and increased glutathione redox index were only observed in the frontal cortex of HSB animals. Frontal cortical GSH and GSSG were inversely correlated while glutathione redox index was positively correlated with stereotypy. Deer mouse stereotypy is thus characterised by a deficient glutathione system in the frontal cortex but not striatum, and provides a therapeutic rationale for using glutathione-active antioxidants in OCD. The evidence for a primary frontal lesion has importance for future OCD research.},

The weather factors include rain, snow, cloud cover, and the calendar factors include seasons and holidays in order to test the proposed model. Findings – Using data from the Korea Tourism Organisation and the Korean Meteorological Administration, the results show that when it was rainy, cloudy, summer or a workday, the number of visitors to the tourism information web site was higher. Originality/value – The results provide managers involved in the tourism industry with useful insights for effective use of web sites by running them more efficiently and setting up appropriate marketing strategies in terms of the weather and calendar variables.},

Few studies have focused on enclosure utilisation in relation to improving the overall welfare of wolves in captivity. A useful way to understand and eventually develop the well-being of captive animals is to contrast different living and social conditions. In the present study, observations of three different wolf enclosures were carried out at two different locations. The enclosure utilisation and related general activity were used as welfare criteria in the three different packs of North American wolves (Canis lupus). Results show that the proportion of time resting was higher in large, comfortable enclosures. In each enclosure animals used only a part of the available space, the proportion being lower in large enclosures. With further research these results could be applied while planning enclosure design, resource allocation and reintroduction and captive breeding efforts for wolves and possibly other socially hierarchical species.},

  abstract = {Quantitative examination of major pathways and routes of exposure to pesticides is essential for determining human risk. The current study was conducted in two apartments and examines the accumulation of the pesticide chlorpyrifos in childrens' toys after the time suggested for reentry after application. It has been established for the first time that a semivolatile pesticide will accumulate on and in toys and other sorbant surfaces in a home via a two-phase physical process that continues for at least 2 weeks postapplication. A summation of the above for a 3-6-year-old child yielded an estimated nondietary total dose of 208 microg/kg/day. Potential exposure from the inhalation pathway was negligible, while dermal and nondietary oral doses from playing with toys contributed to 39 and 61\% of the total dose, respectively. If children with high frequency mouthing behavior are considered as candidates for acute exposure to chlorpyrifos residues, the estimated acute dose could be as high as 356 microg/kg/day. Routine reapplication of pesticides could lead to continued accumulation in toys and other sorbant surfaces, e.g., pillows, with large sorbant reservoirs, which can become a long-term source of exposure to a child. Estimates of a child's nondietary exposure to chlorpyrifos associated with toys and other sorbant surfaces for a period of 1 week following application appear to be of public health concern, and studies of actual childhood exposure from this pathway are warranted in the home environment. The above information should be used to determine if current procedures for postapplication reentry are sufficient and to evaluate the need for procedures to store frequently used household toys, pillows, and other sorbant objects during insecticidal application.},

  abstract = {The genetic modification of crop plants from the methodology involved in their production through to the current debate on their use in agriculture are reviewed. Techniques for plant transformation by Agrobacterium tumefaciens and particle bombardment, and for the selection of transgenic plants using marker genes are described. The benefits of currently available genetically modified (GM) crops in reducing waste and agrochemical use in agriculture, and the potential of the technology for further crop improvement in the future are discussed. The legal requirements for containment of novel GM crops and the roles of relevant regulatory bodies in ensuring that GM crops and food are safe are summarized. Some of the major concerns of the general public regarding GM crops and food: segregation of GM and non-GM crops and cross-pollination between GM crops and wild species, the use of antibiotic resistance marker genes, the prevention of new allergens being introduced in to the food chain and the relative safety of GM and non-GM foods are considered. Finally, the current debate on the use of GM crops in agriculture and the need for the government, scientists and industry to persevere with the technology in the face of widespread hostility is studied.},

  abstract = {The fourth edition of Sex Differences in Cognitive Abilities critically examines the breadth of research on this complex and controversial topic, with the principal aim of helping the reader to understand where sex differences are found and where they are not. Since the publication of the third edition, there have been many exciting and illuminating developments in our understanding of cognitive sex differences. Modern neuroscience has transformed our understanding of the mind and behavior in general, but particularly the way we think about cognitive sex differences. But neuroscience is still in its infancy and has often been misused to justify sex role stereotypes. There has also been the publication of many exaggerated and unreplicated claims regarding cognitive sex differences. Consequently, throughout the book there is recognition of the critical importance of good research; an amiable skepticism of the nature and strength of evidence behind any claim of sex difference; an appreciation of the complexity of the questions about cognitive sex differences; and the ability to see multiple sides of an issues, while also realizing that some claims are well-reasoned and supported by data and others are politicized pseudoscience. The author endeavors to present and interpret all the relevant data fairly, and in the process reveals how there are strong data for many different views. The book explores sex differences from many angles and in many settings, including the effect of different abilities and levels of education on sex differences, pre-existing beliefs or stereotypes, culture, and hormones. Sex differences in the brain are explored along with the stern caveat to "mind the gap" between brain structures and behaviors. Readers should come away with a new understanding of the way nature and nurture work together to make us unique individuals while also creating similarities and differences that are often (but not always) tied to our being female and male. Sex Differences in Cognitive Abilities, Fourth Edition, can be used as a textbook or reference in a range of courses and will inspire the next generation of researchers. Halpern engages readers in the big societal questions that are inherent in the controversial topic of whether, when, and how much males and females differ psychologically. It should be required reading for parents, teachers, and policy makers who want to know about the ways in which males and females are different and similar."},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite being one of the world’s most affected regions, only little is known about the social and spatial distributions of malaria in Indonesian Papua. Existing studies tend to be descriptive in nature; their inferences are prone to confounding and selection biases. At the same time, there remains limited malaria-cartographic activity in the region. Analysing a subset (N = 22,643) of the National Basic Health Research 2007 dataset (N = 987,205), this paper aims to quantify the district-specific risk of malaria in Papua and to understand how socio-demographic/economic factors measured at individual and district levels are associated with individual’s probability of contracting the disease. METHODS: We adopt a Bayesian hierarchical logistic regression model that accommodates not only the nesting of individuals within the island’s 27 administrative units but also the spatial autocorrelation among these locations. Both individual and contextual characteristics are included as predictors in the model; a normal conditional autoregressive prior and an exchangeable one are assigned to the random effects. Robustness is then assessed through sensitivity analyses using alternative hyperpriors. RESULTS: We find that rural Papuans as well as those who live in poor, densely forested, lowland districts are at a higher risk of infection than their counterparts. We also find age and gender differentials in malaria prevalence, if only to a small degree. Nine districts are estimated to have higher-than-expected malaria risks; the extent of spatial variation on the island remains notable even after accounting for socio-demographic/economic risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Although we show that malaria is geography-dependent in Indonesian Papua, it is also a disease of poverty. This means that malaria eradication requires not only biological (proximal) interventions but also social (distal) ones.},

  abstract = {The aim of this exploratory study was to determine heart rate and the levels of oxytocin, cortisol, and insulin in dogs and their owners in response to a short-term interaction. In addition, the dogs' behavior was studied. The owners' responses were compared with those obtained from a control group. Ten female volunteers and their own male Labrador dogs participated in an experiment during which the owner stroked, petted, and talked with her dog during the first 3 minutes. Blood samples were collected from both dog and owner before (0) and at 1, 3, 5, 15, 30, and 60 minutes after the start of the interaction. Blood samples were analyzed by EIA. Heart rate was monitored telemetrically. The data were analyzed using linear mixed models and paired t-tests. The dogs' oxytocin levels were significantly increased 3 minutes after the start of the interaction (p = 0.027). Cortisol levels were significantly increased after 15 and 30 minutes (p = 0.004 and p = 0.022, respectively), and heart rate was significantly decreased after 55 minutes (p = 0.008). The dogs displayed normal behaviors during the experiment. The owners' oxytocin levels peaked between 1 and 5 minutes after interaction (p = 0.026). No such effect was seen in the controls. Cortisol levels displayed a significant decrease at 15 or 30 minutes in both owners and controls, and insulin levels did so at 60 minutes (p = 0.030, p = 0.002 and p = 0.002, p {$<$} 0.0001, respectively). Heart rate decreased significantly in the owners at 55 and 60 minutes (p = 0.0008) but not in the controls. In conclusion, short-term sensory interaction between dogs and their owners influences hormonal levels and heart rate. However, further studies need to be performed in order to better understand the effects of interaction between dogs and their owners.},

  abstract = {In recent years, research in a variety of species has demonstrated that environmental enrichment can be an effective tool to promote animal welfare, enhance captive reproduction efforts, and elicit species-appropriate behaviors that might otherwise not be observed in captivity. The San Diego Zoo is participating in an ongoing comprehensive enrichment plan for its three giant pandas. In February 1998, Panda Team members identified specific goals for each adult panda, and began developing an enrichment plan to meet those goals. All three giant pandas are provided with opportunities to explore their environment and exercise their physical and mental abilities. Behavioral data are routinely collected to assess the effectiveness of the strategies in use. However, meeting the needs of the giant pandas is just the beginning of creating,in effective, long-term enrichment plan. The plan must also consider staff time and effort, institutional requirements, resource availability, visitors' experiences, and research protocols. This paper describes the San Diego Zoo's Giant Panda Enrichment Plan, including the goals set for each panda; the specific enrichment items offered, and their effectiveness; and the mechanisms employed to address limitations due to staff, visitor, institutional, and research needs. The authors discuss the process of developing and maintaining this enrichment plan, and explore potential problems and their solutions, with the specific intention of providing guidelines for other institutions interested in creating an enrichment plan for giant pandas.

No dogs showed significantly more yawning to the open-mouth videos (human or dog).

There were eight sessions: in separate sessions, each dose of cocaine (0, 12, 25, 50 mg) was paired with a money voucher and with a merchandise voucher. The choice to self-administer cocaine significantly increased with escalating cocaine doses, and significantly less cocaine was self-administered when money vouchers were available as compared to merchandise vouchers. These data demonstrate that money vouchers are a more effective alternative reinforcer than merchandise vouchers in cocaine abusers.},

  abstract = {Despite legal protection, deliberate killing by local people is one of the major threats to the conservation of lions and other large carnivores in Africa. Addressing this problem poses particular challenges, mainly because it is difficult to uncover illicit behavior. This article examined two groups of Maasai warriors: individuals who have killed African lions (Panthera leo) and those who have not. We conducted interviews to explore the relationship between attitudes, intentions and known lion killing behavior. Factor analysis and logistic regression revealed that lion killing was mainly determined by: (a) general attitudes toward lions, (b) engagement in traditional customs, (c) lion killing intentions to defend property, and (d) socio-cultural killing intentions. Our results indicated that general attitudes toward lions were the strongest predictor of lion killing behavior. Influencing attitudes to encourage pro-conservation behavior may help reduce killing.},

Binge eaters suffer from high standards and expectations, especially an acute sensitivity to the difficult (perceived) demands of others.

These aversive self-perceptions are accompanied by emotional distress, which often includes anxiety and depression. To escape from this unpleasant state, binge eaters attempt the cognitive response of narrowing attention to the immediate stimulus environment and avoiding broadly meaningful thought. This narrowing of attention disengages normal inhibitions against eating and fosters an uncritical acceptance of irrational beliefs and thoughts.

Gaze alternation often accompanies such pointing gestures, and in species that have no hands this can in itself function as imperative pointing. Dogs have exceptional skills in communicating with humans. The early development of these skills is suggested to have been facilitated by domestication. Adult wolves socialized with humans can use human-provided information to find food in various situations, but it is unclear whether they would use gaze alternation to show their human partner a target location they cannot reach on their own. In our experiment, we tested wolves and dogs in a task where they could indicate an out-of-reach food location to one of two human partners. One partner reacted in a cooperative way and gave the food hidden in the indicated location to the subject whereas the other responded in a competitive way and ate the food herself. Our results suggest that wolves, as well as dogs, use ‘showing’ behaviours to indicate a food location to a human partner, and that both can adjust their communication to the cooperativeness of their human partners, showing more indicating signals in the presence of the cooperative partner than in the presence of the competitive one. We conclude that wolves and dogs, both kept in packs under the same conditions, can use humans as cooperative partners, and point imperatively in order to receive a desired out-of-reach object. It seems that intensive socialization with humans enables both wolves and dogs to communicate cooperatively about a food location with humans, most probably relying on skills that evolved to promote social coordination within their packs.},

  abstract = {Both human and nonhuman primates use imperative pointing to request a desired object from another individual. Gaze alternation often accompanies such pointing gestures, and in species that have no hands this can in itself function as imperative pointing. Dogs have exceptional skills in communicating with humans. The early development of these skills is suggested to have been facilitated by domestication. Adult wolves socialized with humans can use human-provided information to find food in various situations, but it is unclear whether they would use gaze alternation to show their human partner a target location they cannot reach on their own. In our experiment, we tested wolves and dogs in a task where they could indicate an out-of-reach food location to one of two human partners. One partner reacted in a cooperative way and gave the food hidden in the indicated location to the subject whereas the other responded in a competitive way and ate the food herself. Our results suggest that wolves, as well as dogs, use ‘showing’ behaviours to indicate a food location to a human partner, and that both can adjust their communication to the cooperativeness of their human partners, showing more indicating signals in the presence of the cooperative partner than in the presence of the competitive one. We conclude that wolves and dogs, both kept in packs under the same conditions, can use humans as cooperative partners, and point imperatively in order to receive a desired out-of-reach object. It seems that intensive socialization with humans enables both wolves and dogs to communicate cooperatively about a food location with humans, most probably relying on skills that evolved to promote social coordination within their packs.},

  abstract = {Movement pattern variations are reflective of behavioural switches, likely associated with different life history traits in response to the animals’ abiotic and biotic environment. Detecting these can provide rich information on the underlying processes driving animal movement patterns. However, extracting these signals from movement time series, requires tools that objectively extract, describe and quantify these behaviours. The inference of behavioural modes from movement patterns has been mainly addressed through hidden Markov models. Until now, the metrics implemented in these models did not allow to characterize cyclic patterns directly from the raw time series. To address these challenges, we developed an approach to i) extract new metrics of cyclic behaviours and activity levels from a time-frequency analysis of movement time series, ii) implement the spectral signatures of these cyclic patterns and activity levels into a HMM framework to identify and classify latent behavioural states.},

Researchers in these fields routinely use frequentist statistical methods to evaluate the extent to which these interventions impact behavior and the hypothesized mediating processes in the population. However, calls to move beyond the exclusive use of frequentist reasoning are now widespread in psychology and allied fields. We suggest adding Bayesian statistical methods to the researcher’s toolbox of statistical methods.ObjectivesWe first present the basic principles of the Bayesian approach to statistics and why they are useful for researchers in health psychology. We then provide a practical example on how to evaluate intervention effects using Bayesian methods, with a focus on Bayesian hierarchical modeling. We provide the necessary materials for introductory-level readers to follow the tutorial.Conclusion:Bayesian analytical methods are now available to researchers through easy-to-use software packages, and we recommend using them to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions for their conceptual and practical benefits.},

  abstract = {The practice of waterpipe smoking (hookah) has rapidly increased in popularity among young adults yet burgeoning research suggests that its use is associated with nicotine dependence and other negative smoking-related health consequences. Moreover, descriptive studies indicate that consumers may hold the belief that hookah smoking is safer than smoking cigarettes. The current study extended previous work by conducting a comprehensive assessment of patterns and contexts of hookah use, psychological correlates of use, co-occurring substance use as well as social norms and health perceptions surrounding the practice. Participants were 143 ethnically diverse undergraduate students at a large urban US university. Approximately half of the sample (48\%) reported life-time use of hookah and 22\% reported use within the past 30. days. Relative to cigarette smoking, hookah smoking was associated with less perceived harm and addiction potential and higher social approval. Participants who reported life-time hookah use, as compared to those who did not, perceived less associated harm, had a greater number of friends who had tried and approved of hookah, were more likely to use cigarettes, marijuana, and alcohol and in higher frequencies and quantities and were at higher risk for problem tobacco and alcohol use. Among participants who were not current smokers, those with hookah experience were more likely to endorse intent to try a cigarette soon. Hookah users did not differ from non-users on measures of trait anxiety, depression and impulsivity though they were more likely to drink alcohol for coping, social and enhancement purposes than non-users. Implications are discussed for public health initiatives to educate young adults about the potential consequences of hookah smoking. © 2013.},

  abstract = {The past decades have seen a fast increase in the availability and the use of panel data and a rapid development of methods for their analysis. This chapter gives practical guidelines for the analysis of panel data with the statistical software R. We start by suggesting procedures for exploring and re-arranging panel data sets and for preparing them for further analyses. A large part of this chapter demonstrates the application of various “traditional” panel data estimators that are used frequently in scientific and applied analyses. Furthermore, we explain the estimation of several “modern” panel data models, such as panel time series models and dynamic panel data models. Finally, this chapter shows how to use statistical tests to test critical hypotheses under different assumptions and how the results of these tests can be used to select the panel data estimator that is most suitable for a specific empirical panel data analysis.},

  abstract = {We monitored chimpanzee welfare during the introduction of on-exhibit cognitive research training and testing, as measured by behavior and interest in such training, and related individual variation to personality assessments. We observed 11 chimpanzees (six males; five females) over a 16-month period and compared their behavior across three conditions: (1) Baseline (nontraining/research situations) and (2) an on-going, off-exhibit program of Husbandry Training and (3) Research Pod Activities, on-exhibit, group training for cognitive testing. There was considerable individual variation in their interest levels during research sessions; females and those scoring higher for Openness were present more frequently (including those who actively participated and those who observed others participating), but interest did not vary in relation to rates of self-directed behaviors (SDBs), rank, or the level of social disruptions within the group (i.e. large-scale displays or fights). The frequency of SDBs was predicted by the Neuroticism personality factor, but did not differ across baseline and training contexts, indicating that these activities do not negatively impact welfare. We also explored vigilance as an indicator of social uncertainty, but social monitoring did not differ in relation to either social context or rank. Finally, we explored how the specific characteristics of the research context impacted on SDBs; namely, social context, reward contingency, and visual access to keepers. SDBs increased only when visual access to keepers was restricted, suggesting that visual contact reduced uncertainty in novel training contexts. Overall, the introduction of a cognitive research program did not compromise welfare, and the chimpanzees’ repeated interest and willingness to participate suggests that the research was enriching.

Camera traps can be used to record individual tigers moving over an array of locations and provide data for monitoring and studying populations and devising conservation strategies. We suggest using a combination of algorithms to calculate similarity scores between pattern samples scanned from the images to automate the search for a match to a new image. We show how using a three-dimensional surface model of a tiger to scan the pattern samples allows comparison of images that differ widely in camera angles and body posture. The software, which is free to download, considerably reduces the effort required to maintain an image catalogue and we suggest it could be used to trace the origin of a tiger skin by searching a central database of living tigers' images for matches to an image of the skin.},

  abstract = {Animal personality research has become increasingly popular over the past few decades. The two main methods used to examine individual differences in animals are rating and coding. The rating method involves human scoring of an animal's behavioral tendencies along various behavioral dimensions, such ratings are typically based on the human rater's experience with the animal. The coding method also requires humans to score an animal's behavior, but differs in that the scoring is based on the animal's immediate behavior in a specific context. This brief report describes the use of both the rating and coding methods to examine personality within a group of 10 Garnett's bushbabies (Otolemur garnettii). The results indicated that individual personalities do exist in bushbabies, but also suggested that the rating method is heavily influenced by the rater's experience with an animal. Consequently, it is important that the nature of the rater's interactions with the target animals be considered when using the rating method to assess animal personality.},

Subjects had been reared for their first 6 months of life either without access to adults but with constant access to age mates (peer reared), a condition producing reduced exploration and increased fear-related behaviors, or as controls with their mothers; thereafter, all subjects received identical treatment. During home-cage periods, for 1 hr each day, 4 days a week, when the ethanol solution and vehicle were freely available, peer-reared subjects consumed significantly more alcohol than mother-reared subjects. When stress was increased via social separation, mother-reared animals increased their alcohol consumption to a level nearly as high as that of peer-reared monkeys. Average individual differences in alcohol consumption were markedly stable over time. In addition, there were strong positive correlations between alcohol consumption and distress behaviors. Biological indices of increased stress, such as plasma cortisol and corticotropin, were higher in peer-reared subjects. Within the peer- and mother-reared groups, these indices were positively correlated with alcohol consumption. The results suggest that early rearing experiences that predispose monkeys to increased fear-related behaviors produce excessive alcohol consumption under normal living conditions. Furthermore, a major challenge such as social separation increases alcohol consumption to levels producing intoxication even in monkeys not particularly vulnerable to stress.},

In order to develop a novel strategy for this disease, our lab has developed a patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) mouse model for osteosarcoma. The combination of sorafenib (SFN) and palbociclib (PAL) was shown to be effective of hepatocellular carcinoma. However, whether this combination is efficacious on osteosarcoma has not been reported. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of the SFN and PAL combination on a cisplatinum (CDDP)-resistant osteosarcoma PDOX model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Osteosarcoma PDOX models were randomly divided into five treatment groups: untreated-control, CDDP, SFN, PAL and the combination of SFN and PAL. RESULTS: Of these agents, the SFN-PAL combination significantly regressed tumor growth, and enhanced tumor necrosis with degenerative changes in the osteosarcoma PDOX. CONCLUSION: The SFN-PAL combination is an effective treatment strategy for osteosarcoma and therefore holds promise for clinical efficacy.},

The use of rigorous scientific methods to assess this has grown over the past few decades, and so our understanding of the needs of animals has improved during this time. Much of the work in the field of animal welfare has been conducted on farm animals, but it is important to consider how the methods and approaches used in assessing farm animal welfare have been, and can be, adapted and applied to the measurement of welfare in animals in other domains, such as in zoos. This is beneficial to our understanding of both the theoretical knowledge, and the practicability of methods. In this article, some of the commonly-used methods for measuring animal welfare will be discussed, as well as some practical considerations in assessing the welfare of zoo animals.

  abstract = {Wet litter is the most important cause of footpad dermatitis in poultry, this in turn being a highly relevant animal-related welfare indicator. This field study was subdivided into two experiments. In Experiment 1, the standard diet was supplemented by 0.2\% enriched charcoal, being a non-specific absorber and therefore might be promising in reducing faecal moisture. In Experiment 2, the experimental group received a reduced crude protein diet during weeks 6\&ndash;13, combined with a 0.2\% enriched charcoal supplementation. The trials were each conducted with two batches on three farms under on-farm conditions. The animals were observed at 6, 10, 14 and 18 weeks of age to collect data on body weight and different health parameters. The mortality and litter samples were analysed after slaughtering. In Experiment 1, performance and health were not affected despite higher dry matter content of the litter. In Experiment 2, the weight of birds receiving the protein-reduced diet was decreased significantly throughout the experiment. However, the slaughter weight did not differ. The mortality was reduced by 0.5\% in the experimental group. Therefore, it was concluded that 0.2\% of enriched charcoal is not a valuable feed-additive regarding animal health, while temporary protein reduction might have positive effects.},

During the post-treatment period, 300 patients had lost no teeth from periodontal disease, 199 had lost one to three teeth, 76 had lost 4 to 9 teeth and 25 had lost 10 to 23 teeth. 3. Of 2,139 teeth that originally had been considered of questionable prognosis, 666 were lost. Of these, 394 were lost by one sixth of the patients and only 272 by the other five-sixths. 4. Of 1,464 teeth which originally had furcation involvements, 460 were lost, 240 of them by one-sixth of the patients who deteriorated most. 5. The mortality of teeth which were treated with periodontal surgery was compared with that of teeth which did not have surgery. Tooth retention seemed more closely related to the case type than the surgery performed. 6. In general, periodontal disease is bilaterally symmetrical and there is a predictable order of likelihood of tooth loss according to position in the arch.},

We discuss neuronal-network and regional forebrain activity during sleep, and its consequences for consciousness and cognition. Complex interactions in thalamocortical circuits maintain the electroencephalographic oscillations of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Functional neuroimaging affords views of the human brain in both NREM and REM sleep, and has informed new concepts of the neural basis of dreaming during REM sleep -- a state that is characterized by illogic, hallucinosis and emotionality compared with waking. Replay of waking neuronal activity during sleep in the rodent hippocampus and in functional images of human brains indicates possible roles for sleep in neuroplasticity. Different forms and stages of learning and memory might benefit from different stages of sleep and be subserved by different forebrain regions.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: During the past few years serious concern has been raised about the safety of combined estrogen/progestogen hormone therapy, in particular about its effects on the breast. Several observations suggest that androgens may counteract the proliferative effects of estrogen and progestogen in the mammary gland. Thus, we aimed to study the effects of testosterone addition on breast cell proliferation during postmenopausal estrogen/progestogen therapy.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nDESIGN: We conducted a 6-month prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. A total of 99 postmenopausal women were given continuous combined estradiol 2 mg/norethisterone acetate 1 mg and were equally randomly assigned to receive additional treatment with either a testosterone patch releasing 300 microg/24 hours or a placebo patch. Breast cells were collected by fine needle aspiration biopsy at baseline and after 6 months, and the main outcome measure was the percentage of proliferating breast cells positively stained by the Ki-67/MIB-1 antibody.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: A total of 88 women, 47 receiving active treatment and 41 in the placebo group, completed the study. In the placebo group there was a more than fivefold increase (P{$<$}0.001) in total breast cell proliferation from baseline (median 1.1\%) to 6 months (median 6.2\%). During testosterone addition, no significant increase was recorded (1.6\% vs 2.0\%). The different effects of the two treatments were apparent in both epithelial and stromal cells.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: Addition of testosterone may counteract breast cell proliferation as induced by estrogen/progestogen therapy in postmenopausal women.},

Opening with a discussion of Foucault's ?epistemology of critique? and moving to a close reading of his Nietzsche, genealogy history (1977a) this paper both extends Foucault's analytical principles for the analysis of discourse (reversal, discontinuity, specificity, exteriority) and develops, through a series of methodological injunctions (the category of the ?event?, the dissipation of the object, the effacement of the self-constituting subject, the prioritization of the procedures of ?emergence? and ?descent?), an account of genealogy as a mode of effective critique.},

These comparisons are conducted with the view that individuals displaying a greater range of wild-type behaviors have enhanced welfare. Such comparisons have a greater appeal when it comes to primates because increased levels of anthropomorphism toward primates lead to welfare concerns. However, the validity of such comparisons has not been assessed. From the reviewed literature, some of the main complexities identified when defining “good welfare” using activity budgets were the ideas of behavioral motivation and adaptation, obstacles when using the wild as a benchmark for good welfare, study methods causing possible variances in behavior, and social and environmental factors. It is proposed that such influencing factors would be controlled for adequately in future studies with the use of multiple i...},

This study aimed to investigate the overall survival (OS) of patients with advanced HCC in response to different combination therapies.We analyzed the treatment and OS of 401 patients with Barcelona clinic liver cancer stage C HCC between 2012 and 2017. Mortality was analyzed using multivariate Cox regression, and OS was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method.The mean age was 59 years and males were predominant. During a median follow-up time of 8.6 months (range, 1-80 months), 346 (86.2\%) patients died. In the multivariate Cox regression analysis, primary tumor size ≥5{$\mkern1mu$}cm, serum alpha-fetoprotein ≥200, and serum albumin ≥3.5 were significantly associated with mortality. In addition, compared with sorafenib alone, multiple-line treatments with sorafenib and multiple-line treatments without sorafenib yielded significantly decreased mortality. In the Kaplan-Meier analysis, sorafenib with TACE, multiple-line treatments with sorafenib, third-line treatments with sorafenib, and multiple-line treatments without sorafenib yielded a significantly better median OS than sorafenib alone.Sorafenib with concurrent multiple-line therapies significantly improved OS. These combination therapies will provide important information for immunotherapy combination with locoregional therapies in advanced HCC.},

Animals-1,851 dogs belonging to clients of a veterinary teaching hospital or members of national breed clubs and 203 dogs examined by canine behavior practitioners because of behavior problems. PROCEDURE: Owners were asked to complete a questionnaire consisting of 152 items eliciting information on how dogs responded to specific events and situations in their usual environment. Data from completed questionnaires were subjected to factor analysis, and the resulting factors were tested for reliability and validity. RESULTS: Factor analysis yielded 11 factors from 68 of the original questionnaire items that together accounted for 57\% of the common variance in questionnaire item scores. Reliability was acceptable for all but 1 of these factors. Behavior problems in 200 of the 203 dogs with behavior problems could be assigned to 7 diagnostic categories that matched 7 of the factors identified during factor analysis of questionnaire responses. Dogs assigned to particular diagnostic categories had significantly higher scores for corresponding questionnaire factors than did those assigned to unrelated diagnostic categories, indicating that the factors were valid. Validity of the remaining 4 factors could not be examined because of a lack of information on dogs with behavior problems related to these factors. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Findings suggest that the resulting 68-item questionnaire is a reliable and valid method of assessing behavior and temperament traits in dogs.

  abstract = {The overuse of Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games (MMORPGs) is becoming a significant problem worldwide, especially among college students. Similar to Internet addiction, the pathological use of MMORPG is a kind of modern addiction that can affect students' lives on both a physical and a psychological level. The purpose of this study is to understand MMORPG addiction from a user experience design approach. We first developed a complete model that includes eleven factors (challenge, fantasy, curiosity, control, reward, cooperation, competition, recognition, belonging, obligation and role-playing) to represent users' experience in MMORPGs. After that, we design a questionnaire to measure student' gaming experience and level of addiction. Students' demography information, including gender and game playing habits, was also collected. Four hundred and eighteen Taiwanese college students aged 18-25 years old took part in this online survey. Regression analysis was then conducted to evaluate the relative explanatory power of each variable, with addiction score as the dependent variable and the eleven user experience factors as the independent variables. The results of regression analysis reveal five critical factors (curiosity, role-playing, belonging, obligation and reward) that can be used to predict MMORPG addiction. In addition, this study also infers possible casual mechanisms for increasing college students' level of addiction. The implications of our findings for both design and educational practitioners were also discussed. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The overuse of Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games (MMORPGs) is becoming a significant problem worldwide, especially among college students. Similar to Internet addiction, the pathological use of MMORPG is a kind of modern addiction that can affect students' lives on both a physical and a psychological level. The purpose of this study is to understand MMORPG addiction from a user experience design approach.

  abstract = {Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) activity is altered in mood disorders and lower activity associated with aggressive behavior. The gene has a functional polymorphism with a variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) in the upstream regulatory region (MAOA-uVNTR). In this study, we examined possible associations between the MAOA-uVNTR polymorphism and mood disorders, suicidal behavior, aggression/impulsivity, and effects of reported childhood abuse. In total, 663 unrelated subjects with a psychiatric disorder and 104 healthy volunteers were genotyped for the 30 base pair functional VNTR. A novel repeat variation was identified. No statistically significant associations were found between this functional MAOA-uVNTR polymorphism and mood disorders or suicide attempts. However, the lower expression allele was associated with a history of abuse before 15 years of age in male subjects and with higher impulsivity in males but not females. Our results suggest that the lower expression of the MAOA-uVNTR polymorphism is related to a history of early abuse and may sensitize males, but not females, to the effects of early abuse experiences on impulsive traits in adulthood. The polymorphism may be a marker for impulsivity that in turn may contribute to the risk for abuse. This trait could then be further aggravated by abuse.},

  abstract = {Faces are an important visual category for many taxa, and the human face is no exception to this. Because faces differ in subtle ways and possess many idiosyncratic features, they provide a rich source of perceptual cues. A fair amount of those cues are learned through social interactions and are used for future identification of individual humans. These effects of individual experience can be studied particularly well in hetero-specific face perception. Domestic dogs represent a perfect model in this respect, due to their proved ability to extract important information from the human face in socio-communicative interactions. There is also suggestive evidence that dogs can identify their owner or other familiar human individuals by using visual information from the face. However, most studies have used only dogs' looking behavior to examine their visual processing of human faces and it has been demonstrated only that dogs can differentiate between familiar and unknown human faces. Here, we examined the dog's ability to discriminate the faces of two familiar persons by active choice (approach and touch). Furthermore, in successive stages of the experiment we investigated how well dogs discriminate humans in different representations by systematically reducing the informational richness and the quality of the stimuli. We found a huge inter-individual and inter-stage variance in performance, indicating differences across dogs in their learning ability as well as their selection of discriminative cues. On a group level, the performance of dogs significantly decreased when they were presented with pictures of human heads after having learned to discriminate the real heads, and when - after relearning - confronted with the same pictures showing only the inner parts of the heads. However, as two dogs quickly mastered all stages, we conclude that dogs are in principle able to discriminate people on the basis of visual information from their faces and by making active choices. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {Increases in urine drug concentration that result from changes in urinary output may be mistakenly interpreted as new drug use rather than carryover from previous drug exposure. Normalization of drug excretion to urine creatinine concentration reduces the variability of drug measurement attributable to urine dilution. A specimen ratio of 1.5 or greater between two creatinine normalized positive urine cannabinoid tests was previously proposed as an indicator of new marijuana use. This approach has received wide attention for potential use in treatment and employee assistance programs associated with workplace drug testing. Unfortunately, there has been limited evaluation of the usefulness of this ratio under controlled-dosing conditions with marijuana smokers. A controlled clinical study was conducted to examine the excretion profile of creatinine and marijuana metabolites in a group of six marijuana users who smoked two different doses of marijuana over a 4-week period. A relative operating characteristic curve was constructed from sensitivity and specificity data for 26 different specimen ratios ranging from 0.1 to 2.0. The most accurate specimen ratio (85.4\%) for differentiating new use from residual excretion was 0.5. Use of this ratio provided a sensitivity of 80.1\%, a specificity of 90.2\%, and 5.6\% false-positive and 7.4\% false-negative predictions. To substantiate the validity of the 0.5 specimen ratio, urine cannabinoid and creatinine data from a controlled clinical trial specifically addressing water dilution as a means of specimen adulteration were evaluated. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and percent false-positive and percent false-negative predictions were 71.9\%, 91.6\%, 83.9\%, 5.4\%, and 10.7\%, respectively. These data compared favorably with the results from the first clinical study, with the exception of slightly lower sensitivity and higher false-negative percentages in the water dilution study. This would be expected because of the ingestion of large amounts of water and consequent dilution of urine drug concentration. These data indicated that selection of a specimen ratio to evaluate sequential creatinine normalized urine drug concentrations can improve the ability to distinguish residual excretion from new marijuana usage. The selection of an appropriate specimen ratio can be made based on the needs of a specific urine drug-testing program taking into account sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy data.},

  abstract = {Interpretation of marijuana-positive urine tests requires an understanding of the excretion pattern of marijuana metabolites in humans. However, limited urinary excretion data from controlled clinical studies of marijuana use are available. In this study, six subjects smoked a single marijuana cigarette (placebo, 1.75\% delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol [THC], or 3.55\% THC) each week while residing on the clinical ward of the Addiction Research Center. Individual urine specimens were collected for 7 days after drug administration and analyzed for 11-nor-9-carboxy-delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THCCOOH) by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) with a limit of detection of 0.5 ng/mL. Substantial intersubject variability in patterns of THCCOOH excretion was noted between subjects and between doses. Mean THCCOOH concentrations in the first urine collections were 47 +/- 22.3 ng/mL and 75.3 +/- 48.9 ng/mL after the 1.75 and 3.55\% THC cigarettes, respectively. Mean peak urine THCCOOH concentrations averaged 89.8 +/- 31.9 ng/mL and 153.4 +/- 49.2 ng/mL after smoking of approximately 15.8 mg and 33.8 mg THC, respectively. The mean times of peak urine concentration were 7.7 +/- 0.8 h after the 1.75\% THC and 13.9 +/- 3.5 h after the 3.55\% THC dose. Mean GC-MS THCCOOH detection times for the last positive urine sample after the smoking of a single 1.75 or 3.55\% THC cigarette were 33.7 +/- 9.2 h and 88.6 +/- 9.5 h, respectively, when a 15-ng/mL cutoff concentration was used. An average of 93.9 +/- 24.5 micrograms THCCOOH (range, 34.6-171.6 micrograms) was excreted by each subject during the 7-day period after smoking of a single 1.75\% THC cigarette. The average amount of THCCOOH excreted in the same time period after the high dose was 197.4 +/- 33.6 micrograms (range, 107.5-305.0 micrograms). This represented an average of only 0.54 +/- 0.14\% and 0.53 +/- 0.09\% of the original amount of THC in the low-and high-dose cigarettes, respectively. These data provide a detailed complication of THCCOOH concentrations in urine after administration of marijuana that may aid in the interpretation of urine cannabinoid results.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Curative therapy for diabetes mellitus mainly implies replacement of functional insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells, with pancreas or islet-cell transplants. However, shortage of donor organs spurs research into alternative means of generating beta cells from islet expansion, encapsulated islet xenografts, human islet cell-lines, and stem cells. Stem-cell therapy here implies the replacement of diseased or lost cells from progeny of pluripotent or multipotent cells. Both embryonic stem cells (derived from the inner cell mass of a blastocyst) and adult stem cells (found in the postnatal organism) have been used to generate surrogate beta cells or otherwise restore beta-cell functioning. STARTING POINT: Recently, Andreas Lechner and colleagues failed to see transdifferentiation into pancreatic beta cells after transplantation of bone-marrow cells into mice (Diabetes 2004; 53: 616-23). Last year, Jayaraj Rajagopal and colleagues failed to derive beta cells from embryonic stem cells (Science 2003; 299: 363). However, others have seen such effects. WHERE NEXT? As in every emerging field in biology, early reports seem confusing and conflicting. Embryonic and adult stem cells are potential sources for beta-cell replacement and merit further scientific investigation. Discrepancies between different results need to be reconciled. Fundamental processes in determining the differentiation pathways of stem cells remain to be elucidated, so that rigorous and reliable differentiation protocols can be established. Encouraging studies in rodent models may ultimately set the stage for large-animal studies and translational investigation.},

  abstract = {Responses of neurons in inferior temporal cortex during memory-guided visual search. J. Neurophysiol. 80: 2918-2940, 1998. A typical scene will contain many different objects, few of which are relevant to behavior at any given moment. Thus attentional mechanisms are needed to select relevant objects for visual processing and control over behavior. We examined this role of attention in the inferior temporal cortex of macaque monkeys, using a visual search paradigm. While the monkey maintained fixation, a cue stimulus was presented at the center of gaze, followed by a blank delay period. After the delay, an array of two to five choice stimuli was presented extrafoveally, and the monkey was rewarded for detecting a target stimulus matching the cue. The behavioral response was a saccadic eye movement to the target in one version of the task and a lever release in another. The array was composed of one "good" stimulus (effective in driving the cell when presented alone) and one or more "poor" stimuli (ineffective in driving the cell when presented alone). Most cells showed higher delay activity after a good stimulus used as the cue than after a poor stimulus. The baseline activity of cells was also higher preceding a good cue, if the animal expected it to occur. This activity may depend on a top-down bias in favor of cells coding the relevant stimulus. When the choice array was presented, most cells showed suppressive interactions between the stimuli as well as strong attention effects. When the choice array was presented in the contralateral visual field, most cells initially responded the same, regardless of which stimulus was the target. However, within 150-200 ms of array onset, responses were determined by the target stimulus. If the target was the good stimulus, the response to the array became equal to the response to the good stimulus presented alone. If the target was a poor stimulus, the response approached the response to that stimulus presented alone. Thus the influence of the nontarget stimulus was eliminated. These effects occurred well in advance of the behavioral response. When the array was positioned with stimuli on opposite sides of the vertical meridian, the contralateral stimulus appeared to dominate the response, and this dominant effect could not be overcome by attention. Overall, the results support a "biased competition" model of attention, according to which 1) objects in the visual field compete for representation in the cortex, and 2) this competition is biased in favor of the behaviorally relevant object by virtue of "top-down" feedback from structures involved in working memory.},

  abstract = {We isolated and characterized the human oxytocin receptor gene. Southern blots indicated that the human genome has a single copy of the gene. Chromosomal localization by fluorescence in situ hybridization also showed that the gene was a single copy, assigned to 3p26.2 of the human chromosome. The gene spans approximately 17 kilobases and contains 3 introns and 4 exons. Exons 1 and 2 correspond to the 5'-non-coding region, followed by exons 3 and 4 encoding the amino acids of the receptor. Intron 3, which is the largest at 12 kilobases, separates the coding region immediately after the putative sixth transmembrane-spanning domain. The transcription start sites, demonstrated by primer extension analysis, lie 618 and 621 base pairs upstream of the methionine initiation codon. Near these putative transcription start sites, we found a TATA-like motif and a potential SP-1 binding site at about 30 and 65 base pairs, respectively. We also found other known binding sites of transcription regulating factors, such as AP-1, AP-2, GATA-1, Myb, nucleofactor-interleukin 6 binding consensus sequence, and an acute phase reactant-responsive element. No estrogen-responsive element was observed except three half-palindromic estrogen-responsive element motifs. Our findings of the oxytocin receptor gene structure should help to elucidate the mechanism by which the gene expression is induced drastically at parturition in the uterus and how the gene is regulated in other organs such as the mammary gland or central nervous system.},

  abstract = {Summary\textbackslash n There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Montane birds which engage in elevational movements have evolved to cope with fluctuations in environmental hypoxia, through changes in physiological parameters associated with blood oxygen-carrying capacity such as haemoglobin concentration (Hb) and haematocrit (Hct). In particular, elevational migrants which winter at low elevations, encounter varying intensities of avian haemosporidian parasites as they traverse heterogeneous environments. Whilst high intensity parasite infections lead to anaemia, one can expect that the ability to cope with haemosporidian infections should be a key trait for elevational migrants that must be balanced against reducing the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood in response to high elevation. In this study, we explored the links between environmental hypoxia, migration, and disease ecology by examining natural variation in infections status and intensity of avian haemoporidians across a suite of Himalayan birds with different migratory strategies while controlling for host phylogeny. RESULTS We found predictably large variation in haemoglobin levels across the elevational gradient and this pattern was strongly influenced by season and whether birds are elevational migrants. The overall malaria infection intensity declined with elevation whereas Hb and Hct decreased with increase in parasite intensity, suggesting an important role of malaria parasites on hypoxia stressed birds in high elevation environments. CONCLUSIONS Our results provide a key insight into how physiological measures and sub-clinical infections might affect dynamics of high-elevation bird populations. We suggest a potential impact of avian elevational migration on disease dynamics and exposure to high intensity infections with disease spread in the face of climate change, which will exacerbate hypoxic stress and negative effects of chronic avian malaria infection on survival and reproductive success in wild birds. Future work on chronic parasite infections must consider parasite intensity, rather than relying on infection status alone.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The role of androgen decline in the sexual activity of adult males is controversial. To clarify whether sexual function would benefit from testosterone (T) treatment in men with partially or severely reduced serum T levels, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of placebo-controlled studies published in the past 30 years. The aim of this study was to assess and compare the effects of T on the different domains of sexual life. DATA SOURCE: A comprehensive search of all published randomized clinical trials was performed in MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE and Current Contents databases. REVIEW METHODS: Guided by prespecified criteria, software-assisted data abstraction and quality assessed by two independent reviewers, a total of 17 randomized placebo-controlled trials were found to be eligible. For each domain of sexual function we calculated the standardized mean difference relative to T and reported the results of pooled estimates of T treatment using the random effect model of meta-analysis. Heterogeneity, reproducibility and consistency of the findings across studies were explored using sensitivity and meta-regression analysis. RESULTS: Overall, 656 subjects were evaluated: 284 were randomized to T, 284 to placebo (P) and 88 treated in cross-over. The median study length was 3 months (range 1-36 months). Our meta-analysis showed that in men with an average T level at baseline below 12 nmol/l, T treatment moderately improved the number of nocturnal erections, sexual thoughts and motivation, number of successful intercourses, scores of erectile function and overall sexual satisfaction, whereas T had no effect on erectile function in eugonadal men compared to placebo. Heterogeneity was explored by grouping studies according to the characteristics of the study population. A cut-off value of 10 nmol/l for the mean T of the study population failed to predict the effect of treatment, whereas the presence of risk factors for vasculogenic erectile dysfunction (ED), comorbidities and shorter evaluation periods were associated with greater treatment effects in the studies performed in hypogonadal, but not in eugonadal, men. Meta-regression analysis showed that the effects of T on erectile function, but not libido, were inversely related to the mean baseline T concentration. The meta-analysis of available studies indicates that T treatment might be useful for improving vasculogenic ED in selected subjects with low or low-normal T levels. The evidence for a beneficial effect of T treatment on erectile function should be tempered with the caveats that the effect tends to decline over time, is progressively smaller with increasing baseline T levels, and long-term safety data are not available. The present meta-analysis highlights the need, and pitfalls, for large-scale, long-term, randomized controlled trials to formally investigate the efficacy of T replacement in symptomatic middle-aged and elderly men with reduced T levels and ED.},

  abstract = {Captive breeding programs are powerful tools for the conservation of our natural resources. Both animal and plant biodiversity are in global decline (International Union for Conservation of Nature [IUCN] 2008), and the trend is for levels and rates of endangerment to continue increasing (Butchart et al. 2005; see also Chapter 1 by Honeycutt and colleagues). When in-situ conservation efforts are insufficient at stopping or reversing the decline of a species, captive populations often represent the only alternative for forestalling extinction. For example, it is currently estimated that hundreds of amphibian species will soon be extinct if emergency measures are not taken to protect populations in captivity until the threats to wild populations can be halted or overcome (Gascon et al. 2007). The success of numerous captive breeding programs has been well documented. As just a few of many examples, captive breeding programs have saved the black-footed ferret (Mustela nigripes), Przewalski's horse (Equus caballus przewalskii), and the California condor (Gymnogyps californianus) from final extinction (after the last wild populations were extirpated) and new wild populations of the golden lion tamarin (Leontopithecus rosalia), Arabian oryx (Oryx leucoryx), and whooping crane (Grus americana) have been successfully re-established from captive stocks. Conservation breeding programs aim to maintain populations that are representative of their wild counterparts, to provide a reservoir for future reintroductions and recovery efforts (see Chapter 12 by Rhodes and Latch). Thus, the genetic goals of captive population management are to minimize genetic drift, retain genetic diversity, restrict inbreeding, and limit adaptation to captivity (Lacy 1994). The foundations of most captive breeding programs are pedigree analyses, which are used to manage both the demography and genetics of captive populations (Ballou\&Foose 1996).},

  abstract = {Enrichment aims to improve captive animals' welfare by enhancing their environments. Two of the struggles associated with measuring welfare are identifying when animals' needs are being met or surpassed and identifying how individual differences play a role in these outcomes. Using a group of related Guyanese squirrel monkeys, we studied changes in five welfare indicators under different environmental conditions. Manipulating food presentation, walkways, and toys, we created five enrichment levels ranging from just above USDA standards to considerably more complex than the animals' normal housing. At the end of each level, a novelty test was performed in which an unfamiliar woman entered the enclosure and offered food. Changes in behavior as a function of enrichment condition were analyzed using a repeated-measures MANOVA. Compared to baseline, less enrichment consistently increased negative welfare indicators (abnormal behavior, aggression, and negative responses to the novelty test), while more enrichment sometimes decreased these indicators. Positive welfare indicators were less consistently related to enrichment, but positive response to the novelty test did increase somewhat in the most enriched condition. Across conditions, rank correlations revealed that individuals had highly consistent individual differences in positive responses to novelty and somewhat consistent individual differences in rates of aggression. The goal of the enrichment and the species, sex, and individual animals to be enriched should be considered when selecting a welfare indicator, and facilities measuring animal welfare should study changes in the behavior of specific individuals to control for individual differences.

Computerized tomography (CT) scan of brain showed a soft tissue non-enhancing mass with erosion of sphenoid sinus. However CSF findings showed no fungal or bacterial pathogen. Trophozoites of Naegleria fowleri were detected in the direct microscopic examination of CSF and these were grown in culture on non-nutrient agar. The patient was put on amphotericin-B, rifampicin and ceftazidime but his condition deteriorated and was taken home by his relatives in a moribund condition against medical advice and subsequently died. A literature review of 7 previous reports of PAM in India is also presented. Four of theses eight cases were non lethal. The mean age was 13.06 years with male: female ratio of 7:1. History of contact with water was present in four cases. Trophozoites could be identified in all 8 cases in this series.},

  abstract = {In anticipation of a major construction project in an urban New Zealand zoo, a study was initiated to assess the response to construction noise of selected animal species (elephant, giraffe, emu and alligator) previously observed to be sensitive to this kind of noise. The overall aim was to detect any signs of aversive responses to this noise to enable keepers to recognize these and take any necessary mitigating actions during the construction period. The experimental approach involved the creation of acoustic maps of each focal animal enclosure, a series of 90-min video recordings of the animals\&rsquo; behavior in response to ambient noise (control) and amplified broadcast of pre-recorded continuous and intermittent construction noise. Concentration of fecal corticosterone metabolites was also measured for the emus. Key findings were that giraffes, elephants and emus appeared to show an increase in behaviors that could indicate stress or agitation including vigilance and locomotion and may prefer quieter regions of their enclosure during sound exposure. Giraffes also increased close contact with conspecifics when exposed to construction noise. While alligators did not show clear evidence of noise-related stress, our findings indicated that all focal species showed some behavioral responses to recorded construction noise.},

Two captive groups of Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata), one housed in a forested enclosure and the other in a nonvegetated enclosure, were studied to examine the effect of environmental enrichment on age class differences in feeding behavior. Although there was no significant age class difference in time spent feeding on provisioned foods in either enclosure, the feeding rate (intake of unit food/minute) of adults consuming provisioned monkey chow was significantly higher than that of immatures in both enclosures, and was faster for both age groups in the nonvegetated than in the forested enclosure. Overall, feeding time was greatly extended for individuals of both age classes in the forested enclosure compared with their counterparts in the nonvegetated enclosure. Immatures in the forested enclosure utilized a significantly greater number of plant species and food items, exploiting many food items available among the terminal branches, and spent significantly more time feeding than adults. Perhaps constrained by larger body size, adults fed more often on the ground or middle height of the trees, likely reducing competition over plant food resources between adults and immatures. The natural vegetation played an important role in extending feeding time and segregating substrate use during feeding by adults and immatures. This study revealed the benefits concerning environmental enrichment of a naturally forested enclosure, which provides captive primates the opportunity to exhibit age class and species-typical feeding behaviors of importance for their dietary maintenance and general health.},

Why handwriting has this facilitative effect and how this is accomplished were explored in a series of studies using overt behavioral measures and functional neuroimaging of the brain in 4- to 5-year-old children. My colleagues and I showed that early handwriting practice affects visual symbol recognition because it results in the production of variable visual forms that aid in symbol understanding. Further, the mechanisms that support this understanding lay in the communication between visual and motor systems in the brain: Handwriting serves to link visual processing with motor experience, facilitating subsequent letter recognition skills. These results are interpreted in the larger context of the facilitatory effect that learning through action has on perceptual capabilities.},

  abstract = {Dispersal is a mechanism hypothesized to have evolved to reduce resource competition, competition for mates and inbreeding. Although bobcats Lynx rufus are believed to exhibit high dispersal rates, bobcat dispersal has not been extensively studied due to limitations associated with traditional field research methods. We examined dispersal patterns in a southern Texas bobcat population using eight microsatellites by estimating relatedness within the population and among individuals and observing dispersal events via radio-telemetry. Relatedness among females (r = 0.050, ¬¨¬± 0.042, 95\% CI) was significantly higher than among males (r = -0.075, ¬¨¬± 0.031). Pair-wise relatedness distribution for females was significantly different from the expected random distribution and skewed towards 1st and 2nd degree relatives. In contrast, pair-wise relatedness distribution for males was not significantly different from the expected random distribution. Male-biased dispersal and female philopatry were hypothesized to explain the observed patterns in relatedness. Among nine radio-collared females and 12 radio-collared males, two females and six males dispersed away from the study site. This study provides genetic and observational evidence for male-biased dispersal in a solitary felid and is consistent with dispersal trends in mammals. ¬¨¬© Wildlife Biology.},

Methods: Older adolescent university students completed an online survey containing the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 depression screen (PHQ) and a weeklong ESM data collection period to assess SNS use. Results: Participants (N = 190) included in the study were 58\% female and 91\% Caucasian. The mean age was 18.9 years (standard deviation =.8). Most used SNSs for either {$<$}30 minutes (n = 100, 53\%) or between 30 minutes and 2 hours (n = 74, 39\%); a minority of participants reported daily use of SNS {$>$}2 hours (n = 16, 8\%). The mean PHQ score was 5.4 (standard deviation = 4.2). No associations were seen between SNS use and either any depression (p =.519) or moderate to severe depression (p =.470). Conclusions: We did not find evidence supporting a relationship between SNS use and clinical depression.

  abstract = {Children with malformations of cortical development (MCD) frequently have associated cognitive impairments which reduce quality of life. We hypothesized that cognitive deficits associated with MCD can be improved with environmental manipulation or additional training. The E17 methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM) exposure model bears many anatomical hallmarks seen in human MCDs as well as similar behavioral and cognitive deficits. We divided control and MAM exposed Sprague-Dawley rats into enriched and non-enriched groups and tested performance in the Morris water maze. Another group similarly divided underwent sociability testing and also underwent Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans pre and post enrichment. A third group of control and MAM rats without enrichment were trained until they reached criterion on the place avoidance task. MAM rats had impaired performance on spatial tasks and enrichment improved performance of both control and MAM animals. Although MAM rats did not have a deficit in sociability they showed similar improvement with enrichment as controls. MRI revealed a whole brain volume decrease with MAM exposure, and an increase in both MAM and control enriched volumes in comparison to non-enriched animals. In the place avoidance task, MAM rats required approximately 3 times as long to reach criterion as control animals, but with additional training were able to reach control performance. Environmental manipulation and additional training can improve cognition in a rodent MCD model. We therefore suggest that patients with MCD may benefit from appropriate alterations in educational strategies, social interaction and environment. These factors should be considered in therapeutic strategies.},

Several electrically controlled feeding boxes were installed and access to each box was possible only twice a day for 15 min at semi-random times. The boxes had to be opened actively by the tigers. Two trials were carried out: one with solitary confinement, and one with paired confinement. During box feeding, the female's stereotyped pacing was significantly reduced from 16\% (solitary confinement, conventional feeding) and 7\% (paired confinement, conventional feeding) to 1\% (solitary confinement) and less than 0.01\% (paired confinement) of the daily observed time. The female's sleeping increased significantly in both solitary and paired confinement. The male only showed a significant reduction in stereotyped pacing behavior when kept with the female (conventional feeding: 10\%; box feeding: {$<$}0.01\% of the daily observed time). On days with a box-feeding regime in paired confinement, the male spent 25\% (83 min) of the observed time with active behavior at the feeding boxes. The results support the hypothesis that permanently frustrated appetitive foraging behavior causes stereotyped pacing in adult tigers. ¬®¬© 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {Estimates of genetic components are important for our understanding of how individual characteristics are transferred between generations. We show that the level of heritability varies between 0.12 and 0.68 in six morphological traits in house sparrows (Passer domesticus L.) in northern Norway. Positive and negative genetic correlations were present among traits, suggesting evolutionary constraints on the evolution of some of these characters. A sexual difference in the amount of heritable genetic variation was found in tarsus length, wing length, bill depth and body condition index, with generally higher heritability in females. In addition, the structure of the genetic variance-covariance matrix for the traits differed between the sexes. Genetic correlations between males and females for the morphological traits were however large and not significantly different from one, indicating that sex-specific responses to selection will be influenced by intersexual differences in selection differentials. Despite this, some traits had heritability above 0.1 in females, even after conditioning on the additive genetic covariance between sexes and the additive genetic variances in males. Moreover, a meta-analysis indicated that higher heritability in females than in males may be common in birds. Thus, this indicates sexual differences in the genetic architecture of birds. Consequently, as in house sparrows, the evolutionary responses to selection will often be larger in females than males. Hence, our results suggest that sex-specific additive genetic variances and covariances, although ignored in most studies, should be included when making predictions of evolutionary changes from standard quantitative genetic models.},

Review of these references led to identification of relevant materials published prior to 1966. In addition, participants identified other references and sources. CONSENSUS PROCESS: Three formal drafts of the statement that synthesized information obtained in the formal evidence-gathering process were reviewed by members of the working group. Consensus was achieved on the final draft. CONCLUSIONS: A weapon using airborne tularemia would likely result 3 to 5 days later in an outbreak of acute, undifferentiated febrile illness with incipient pneumonia, pleuritis, and hilar lymphadenopathy. Specific epidemiological, clinical, and microbiological findings should lead to early suspicion of intentional tularemia in an alert health system; laboratory confirmation of agent could be delayed. Without treatment, the clinical course could progress to respiratory failure, shock, and death. Prompt treatment with streptomycin, gentamicin, doxycycline, or ciprofloxacin is recommended. Prophylactic use of doxycycline or ciprofloxacin may be useful in the early postexposure period.},

  abstract = {The social organization of Asiatic lions (Panthera leo persica) differs from African lions (P. l. leo) in that breeding lionesses defend resource based territories while male coalitions maximize coverage of female groups. Thus, lion density in the Gir forests of India is dictated by female territory size. We studied the home range and habitat preference of lions using radio telemetry on seven lionesses spaced throughout the Gir between 2002 and 2005. Radio locations obtained by homing in were plotted on a classified (LISS III FCC) habitat map of Gir to obtain habitat use and availability. Habitat preference was computed using compositional analysis and Ivlev's index. Average (±SE) 100\% Minimum Convex Polygon (MCP) range of six lionesses was 48.2~±~10.6~km2, 95\% MCP was 34.7~±~7.8~km2 and 95\% fixed kernel range size was 32.5~±~8.2~km2. Breeding female group density and group size was about 3 per 100~km2 and 1.3 (0.5 SD, n~=~45) respectively. Lions were observed to show a habitat preference ( \{Mathematical expression\}, P~=~0.08), the order of preference was Moist Mixed forests~{$>~$}Mixed forests~{$>~$}Savanna habitats~{$>~$}Teak-Acacia-Zizyphus-Anogeissus forests~{$>~$}Acacia-Lannea-Boswellia forests~{$>~$}Thorn and Scrub forests~{$>~$}Agriculture areas. Habitat preference during the day was for dense vegetation ( \{Mathematical expression\}, P~{$<~$}0.001). At night lions even ventured into agricultural fields. Our data suggests that dense habitats are preferred by lions in Gir to escape the heat of the day and to be in good cover when human activity was likely to be at its peak within forested areas. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

  abstract = {1. An understanding of the nutritional ecology of endangered ungulates inhabiting a highly managed ecosystem would be of significant value for directing habitat management inputs. In this study seasonal food habits of the endangered blackbuck antelope Antelope cervicapra were studied by observing wild and captive blackbuck feeding in different habitats within Velavadar National Park, India. Proportional use of different habitats was estimated in each season for 2 years. Seasonal forage consumption and digestibility were estimated using captive blackbuck subsisting on natural forage. 2. Blackbuck primarily used grassland habitat for grazing. Dicanthium annulatum and pods of the exotic shrub Prosopis juliflora contributed 35\% and 9.5\% to the annual dry matter intake, respectively. Forage consumption and nutrient digestibility were high in the monsoon and winter seasons, but low in summer. Both were positively correlated with crude protein content of the forage. In summer, the crude protein content of forage (3.6\%) was below the critical requirements of ungulates. Apparent digestibility of crude protein was negative during summers. 3. Faecal nitrogen content and faecal ether extract were correlated with forage quality and digestibility. These were used to develop relationships for estimating forage quality. 4. Seasonal lows in forage quality, which became even more pronounced during droughts, together with limited grazing area were considered to be important limiting factors for blackbuck. Pods of P. juliflora were considered a significant food resource, especially when grazing deteriorated. Therefore, total eradication of this exotic shrub from the park would not be desirable. Instead, managing the Prosopis to produce more available pods is recommended. Increasing the grazing area of the park and/or managing the habitat to produce high quality forage, especially during summer, would benefit the blackbuck population.},

Candidate methylation loci were further investigated as risk loci for a general psychiatric risk score in two cohorts of adolescents (cohort 1 and 2). The genome-wide methylation pattern was measured in whole blood using the Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip. Subjects were stratified into high-risk and low-risk groups based on the severity of the suicidal behavior. We included CpG sites located within 2000 basepairs away from transcriptional start site of the following HPA-axis coupled genes: corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH), corticotropin releasing hormone binding protein (CRHBP), corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 1 (CRHR1), corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 2 (CRHR2), FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP5) and the glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1). The methylation state of two corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH)-associated CpG sites were significantly hypomethylated in the high-risk group of suicide attempters (n = 31) (cg19035496 and cg23409074) (p {$<$}. 0.001). Adolescent cohort 1 and 2 consisted of 129 and 93 subjects, respectively, and were stratified by the in silico generated DAWBA measurements of a general psychiatric risk score into high-risk group ({$>$}∼50\% risk) or controls. In adolescent cohort 2, cg19035496 was hypermethylated in subjects with a high general psychiatric risk score. Our results show epigenetic changes in the CRH gene related to severity of suicide attempt in adults and a general psychiatric risk score in adolescents.},

  abstract = {The analysis of matrix population models has become a fundamental tool in ecology, conservation biology, and life history theory. In this paper, I present demogR, a pack- age for analyzing age-structured population models in R. The package includes tools for the construction and analysis of matrix population models. In addition to the standard analyses commonly used in evolutionary demography and conservation biology, demogR contains a variety of tools from classical demography. This includes the construction of period life tables, and the generation of model mortality and fertility schedules for human populations. The tools in demogR are generally applicable to age-structured populations but are particularly useful for analyzing problems in human ecology. I illustrate some of the capabilities of the package by doing an evolutionary demographic analysis of several human populations.},

  abstract = {Genetic diversity and population structure were investigated across the core range of Tasmanian devils (Sarcophilus laniarius; Dasyuridae), a wide-ranging marsupial carnivore restricted to the island of Tasmania. Heterozygosity (0.386-0.467) and allelic diversity (2.7-3.3) were low in all subpopulations and allelic size ranges were small and almost continuous, consistent with a founder effect. Island effects and repeated periods of low population density may also have contributed to the low variation. Within continuous habitat, gene flow appears extensive up to 50 km (high assignment rates to source or close neighbour populations; nonsignificant values of pairwise FST), in agreement with movement data. At larger scales (150-250 km), gene flow is reduced (significant pairwise FST) but there is no evidence for isolation by distance. The most substantial genetic structuring was observed for comparisons spanning unsuitable habitat, implying limited dispersal of devils between the well-connected, eastern populations and a smaller northwestern population. The genetic distinctiveness of the northwestern population was reflected in all analyses: unique alleles; multivariate analyses of gene frequency (multidimensional scaling, minimum spanning tree, nearest neighbour); high self-assignment (95\%); two distinct populations for Tasmania were detected in isolation by distance and in Bayesian model-based clustering analyses. Marsupial carnivores appear to have stronger population subdivisions than their placental counterparts.},

  abstract = {Among reptiles, reproduction in the absence of males is often assumed to result from long-term sperm storage. Through the application of molecular genetic tools, biologists are beginning to recognize that facultative parthenogenesis can also explain such reproductive events in snakes. We observed a Copperhead ( Agkistrodon contortrix) give birth to a stillborn neonate and four infertile ova after 9 yr in isolation from male snakes. To test the hypothesis that the neonate was produced asexually, we screened a panel of 10 microsatellite loci to genotype the mother and her offspring, as well as wild-caught individuals in the mother's population of origin, to assess the probability of paternity. Confirming prior research on Copperheads that suggests parthenogenesis by terminal fusion automixis, we found that four heterozygous maternal loci were homozygous in the neonate. We calculated the probability of a random male from the population as a sire to the neonate to be 2.32 × 10−13 by using the population allele frequencies and the genotype of the neonate. These results further confirm that Copperheads are facultatively parthenogenetic and suggest that this reproductive mode may be general within the species. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

  abstract = {Environmental enrichment is used to enhance the well-being of captive animals and to prevent or reduce stereotypic and other abnormal behaviours. However, environmental enrichment does not always succeed in its intended purpose. We investigated whether personality (i.e. consistent individual variation in behaviour) predicts whether and how stereotypic African striped mice interact with environmental enrichments, since this could explain why enrichments vary in their efficacy. Stereotypic and non-stereotypic individuals of both sexes were tested for their personality using three standard tests (i.e. novel-object, light-dark and startle-response tests) as sub-adults at 43 days of age. Thereafter, striped mice were introduced individually to cages of different complexity, i.e. Standard (standard laboratory housing, provided with nest box, bedding and a toilet roll), Standard-enriched (same as Standard treatment with one/two cardboard tubes/Habitrail ™ PVC tunnel), and Enriched (large tank with nest box with bedding and enrichment − running wheel, one/two cardboard tubes, Habitrail ™ PVC tunnels and balls) treatments in a random sequence. We measured the duration of stereotypy, activity and inactivity of individuals in all treatments. At a group level, stereotypic striped mice showed a proactive coping style, by showing greater activity in the Enriched treatment, while non-stereotypic striped mice showed reactive coping by displaying greater levels of inactivity in the three treatments. At within-group level, however, both stereotypic and non-stereotypic striped mice varied levels of proactivity or reactivity depending on the environment to which they were exposed. Specifically, in stereotypic individuals, 66\% increased and 34\% decreased activity from the Standard-enriched to Enriched treatment, and 57\% decreased and 43\% increased stereotypy in the Enriched treatment. In non-stereotypic individuals, 50\% increased and 50\% decreased activity from Standard to Standard-enriched treatment, and 83\% increased activity in Enriched treatment. Our findings provide novel evidence in captive rodents that behavioural responses of both stereotypic and non-stereotypic striped mice to environmental enrichment were associated with their personality at a group but not at within-group level.},

This ground-breaking work, voted one of the top ten books of 2010 by VegNews Magazine, offers an absorbing look at why and how humans can so wholeheartedly devote ourselves to certain animals and then allow others to suffer needlessly, especially those slaughtered for our consumption.Social psychologist Melanie Joy explores the many ways we numb ourselves and disconnect from our natural empathy for farmed animals. She coins the term "carnism" to describe the belief system that has conditioned us to eat certain animals and not others. In Why We Love Dogs, Eat Pigs, and Wear Cows Joy investigates factory farming, exposing how cruelly the animals are treated, the hazards that meatpacking workers face, and the environmental impact of raising 10 billion animals for food each year. Controversial and challenging, this book will change the way you think about food forever.},

  abstract = {The misfolding and aggregation of specific proteins is a seminal occurrence in a remarkable variety of neurodegenerative disorders. In Alzheimer’s disease (the most prevalent cerebral proteopathy), the two principal aggregating proteins are β-amyloid (Aβ) and tau. The abnormal assemblies formed by conformational variants of these proteins range in size from small oligomers to the characteristic lesions that are visible by optical microscopy, such as senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Pathologic similarities with prion disease suggest that the formation and spread of these proteinaceous lesions might involve a common molecular mechanism – corruptive protein templating. Experimentally, cerebral β-amyloidosis can be exogenously induced by exposure to dilute brain extracts containing aggregated Aβ seeds. The amyloid-inducing agent probably is Aβ itself, in a conformation generated most effectively in the living brain. Once initiated, Aβ lesions proliferate within and among brain regions. The induction process is governed by the structural and biochemical nature of the Aβ seed, as well as the attributes of the host, reminiscent of pathogenically variant prion strains. The concept of prion-like induction and spreading of pathogenic proteins recently has been expanded to include aggregates of tau, α- synuclein, huntingtin, superoxide dismutase-1, and TDP-43, which characterize such human neurodegenerative disorders as frontotemporal lobar degeneration, Parkinson’s/Lewy body disease, Huntington’s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Our recent finding that the most effective Aβ seeds are small and soluble intensifies the search in bodily fluids for misfolded protein seeds that are upstream in the proteopathic cascade, and thus could serve as predictive diagnostics and the targets of early, mechanism-based interventions. Establishing the clinical implications of corruptive protein templating will require further mechanistic and epidemiologic investigations. However, the theory that many chronic neurodegenerative diseases can originate and progress via the seeded corruption of misfolded proteins has the potential to unify experimental and translational approaches to these increasingly prevalent disorders.},

Two satirical readings were selected from the New York Times. These readings (one addressing government issues, the other education policy) were each printed in Times New Roman and Arial fonts of the same size and presented in randomized order to 102 university students, who ranked the readings on a number of adjective descriptors. Analysis showed that satirical readings in Times New Roman were perceived as more funny and angry than those in Arial, the combination of emotional perception which is congruent with the definition of satire. This apparent interaction of font type with emotional qualities of text has implications for marketing, advertising, and the persuasive literature.},

  abstract = {The familiar mathematical topics of introductory statistics --- means, proportions, t-tests, normal and t distributions, chi-squared, etc. --- are a product of the first half of the 20th century. Naturally, they reflect the statistical conditions of that era: scarce, e.g.             n             {$<$} 10, data originating in benchtop or agricultural experiments; algorithms communicated via algebraic formulas. Today, applied statistics relates to a different environment: software is the means of algorithmic communication, observational and "unplanned" data are interpreted for causal relationships, and data are large both in             n             and the number of variables. This change in situation calls for a thorough rethinking of the topics in and approach to statistics education. This paper presents a set of ten organizing blocks for intro stats that are better suited to today's environment.},

  abstract = {Tropical dry-deciduous forests comprise more than45\%of the tiger (Panthera tigris) habitat in India.However, in the absence of rigorously derived estimates of ecological densities of tigers in dry forests, critical baseline data for managing tiger populations are lacking. In this study tiger densitieswere estimated using photographic capture–recapture sampling in the dry forests of Panna Tiger Reserve in Central India. Over a 45-day survey period, 60 camera trap sites were sampled in a well-protected part of the 542-km2 reserve during 2002. A total sampling effort of 914 camera-trap-days yielded photo-captures of 11 individual tigers over 15 samp- ling occasions that effectively covered a 418-km2 area. The closed capture–recapture model Mh,which incorporates individual heterogeneity in capture probabilities, fitted these photographic capture history data well. The estimated capture probability/sample, ˆ p=0.04, resulted in an estimated tiger population size and standard error ( ˆ N(S ˆ N)) of 29 (9.65), and a density ( ˆ E ˆ D(S ˆD)) of 6.94 (3.23) tigers/100km2. The estimated E ˆ tiger density matched predictions based on prey abundance. Our results suggest that, if managed appropriately, the available dry forest habitat in India has the potential to support a population size of about 9000 wild tigers. INTRODUCTION},

  abstract = {Globally expanding human land use sets constantly increasing pressure for maintenance of biological diversity and functioning ecosystems. To fight the decline of biological diversity, conservation science has broken ground with methods such as the operational model of systematic conservation planning (SCP), which focuses on design and on-the-ground implementation of conservation areas. The most commonly used method in SCP is reserve selection that focuses on the spatial design of reserve networks and their expansion. We expanded these methods by introducing another form of spatial allocation of conservation effort relevant for land-use zoning at the landscape scale that avoids negative ecological effects of human land use outside protected areas. We call our method inverse spatial conservation prioritization. It can be used to identify areas suitable for economic development while simultaneously limiting total ecological and environmental effects of that development at the landscape level by identifying areas with highest economic but lowest ecological value. Our method is not based on a priori targets, and as such it is applicable to cases where the effects of land use on, for example, individual species or ecosystem types are relatively small and would not lead to violation of regional or national conservation targets. We applied our method to land-use allocation to peat mining. Our method identified a combination of profitable production areas that provides the needed area for peat production while retaining most of the landscape-level ecological value of the ecosystem. The results of this inverse spatial conservation prioritization are being used in land-use zoning in the province of Central Finland.},

  abstract = {• Why do our headaches persist after taking a one-cent aspirin but disappear when we take a 50-cent aspirin? • Why does recalling the Ten Commandments reduce our tendency to lie, even when we couldn't possibly be caught? • Why do we splurge on a lavish meal but cut coupons to save 25 cents on a can of soup? • Why do we go back for second helpings at the unlimited buffet, even when our stomachs are already full? • And how did we ever start spending \$4.15 on a cup of coffee when, just a few years ago, we used to pay less than a dollar? When it comes to making decisions in our lives, we think we're in control. We think we're making smart, rational choices. But are we? In a series of illuminating, often surprising experiments, MIT behavioral economist Dan Ariely refutes the common assumption that we behave in fundamentally rational ways. Blending everyday experience with groundbreaking research, Ariely explains how expectations, emotions, social norms, and other invisible, seemingly illogical forces skew our reasoning abilities. Not only do we make astonishingly simple mistakes every day, but we make the same types of mistakes, Ariely discovers. We consistently overpay, underestimate, and procrastinate. We fail to understand the profound effects of our emotions on what we want, and we overvalue what we already own. Yet these misguided behaviors are neither random nor senseless. They're systematic and predictable--making us predictably irrational. From drinking coffee to losing weight, from buying a car to choosing a romantic partner, Ariely explains how to break through these systematic patterns of thought to make better decisions. Predictably Irrational will change the way we interact with the world--one small decision at a time. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(cover)},

  abstract = {Food consumption and body weight were recorded for 6 male and 3 female captive Pacific walruses. The study is based on historical data that were recorded for short-term husbandry purposes. Most animals came as calves from the wild and received formula during their first year at the park, although one male calf was born at the park, and was suckled. He began to eat fish at the age of 7 months and was fully weaned at the age of 19 months. During the calendar year of birth and the following year, all but one of the walruses were raised on formula. Thereafter the walruses consumed solid food, and the annual food intakes varied strongly between individuals of the same sex and age. In one female, a pronounced increase occurred in the year during which she was pregnant, gave birth, and suckled the calf for the rest of that year and the following calendar year. During gestation, her body weight increased from 750 kg to 1100 kg. The calendar year after delivery her food intake remained above normal. For the entire lactation period, the mother consumed 91\% more food than during similar periods in non-reproductive years. The year after weaning, food intake of the mother decreased below the pre-reproductive level. In one male a rapid increase in food intake occurred after the age of 12 years. This coincided with a strong secondary growth spurt, following sexual maturity. During the first 4 years of life, the period of rapid growth, food consumption generally increased each month. Thereafter, there were seasonal fluctuations in food intake. These fluctuations appeared to be related to reproduction (February-April in males, and February in females) and molt (June-August). The body weight of one female stabilized at around 1200 kg, that of another at 750 kg. The body weight of the 2 males stabilized around 1400 kg. Between weaning and attaining a body weight of approximately 800 kg, individuals showed a negative relationship between body weight and food intake as a percentage of body weight. Adult walruses consumed between 2 and 3\% of body weight per day in fish.},

  abstract = {Time series deals with data that has been recorded or observed over time. These data may need to be analyzed to come up with conclusions and meet the objectives intended by the researcher. A time series may be expressed as an additive model of its components which includes the seasonal, the cyclic, the trend and irregular components. When time series data is analyzed it becomes very key in forecasting or prediction of future time series values, in control of machines among others. In this study it has been noted that though most researchers may be in a position to collect time series data, it is a challenge in analyzing it since some of the steps they are aware of may be complex and not straight forward. This then implies that analysis of time series data needs a great understanding and knowledge of the procedure and the models that can be useful in meeting the researcher's objectives. This writing discusses the application of ARIMA model in analyzing time series data in a sophisticated and interactive package known as R. The procedure is vividly stated and explained with aid of some R commands and illustrations. It is expected that the researchers or students who take statistical projects in this area will greatly benefit from this work.},

  abstract = {Cognitive bias tasks purport to assess affective states via responses to ambiguous stimuli. We hypothesized that a novel cognitive bias task based on positive reinforcement using quantity differences would detect changes in affect in captive grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis). We trained bears (n = 8) to respond differently (nose or paw touch) to two stimuli (light or dark gray cue cards), with responses counterbalanced across bears. The two cues signaled a small or large food reward, respectively. Responses to ambiguous probe stimuli (i.e., shades of gray) intermediate to the trained stimuli were classified as either 'optimistic,' appropriate for the larger reward, or 'pessimistic,' appropriate for the smaller reward. In Experiment 1, we explored the contrast in reward size necessary to detect a change in response across probe stimuli (large reward, 3 or 6 apple slices: small reward, 1 slice). We observed a change in response across probe stimuli, with no difference in response between reward-value groups, indicating that a contrast of 3:1 apple slices was sufficient to affect responses. In Experiment 2, we investigated cognitive bias after 2.1 h of exposure to enrichment items varying in attractiveness. Results were unaffected by enrichment type or time spent interacting with enrichments, indicating that the task failed to demonstrate criterion validity for comparing mood following exposure to different enrichment items. However, greater time spent pacing prior to testing was associated with 'optimistic' judgments. The data provide some support for use of cognitive bias tasks based on quantity differences in animal welfare assessments involving captive wildlife.},

  abstract = {Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) is a method that has been frequently used to determine the presence of long-range correlations in human and animal behaviors. However, according to previous authors using statistical model systems, in order to correctly use DFA different aspects should be taken into account such as: (1) the establishment by hypothesis testing of the absence of short term correlation, (2) an accurate estimation of a straight line in the log–log plot of the fluctuation function, (3) the elimination of artificial crossovers in the fluctuation function, and (4) the length of the time series. Taking into consideration these factors, herein we evaluated the presence of long-range correlation in the temporal pattern of locomotor activity of Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix) and mosquito larva (Culex quinquefasciatus). In our study, modeling the data with the general autoregressive integrated moving average (ARFIMA) model, we rejected the hypothesis of short-range correlations (d=0) in all cases. We also observed that DFA was able to distinguish between the artificial crossover observed in the temporal pattern of locomotion of Japanese quail and the crossovers in the correlation behavior observed in mosquito larvae locomotion. Although the test duration can slightly influence the parameter estimation, no qualitative differences were observed between different test durations.},

The baboons' age-sex class and location were recorded at 10 minute intervals over a 60 minute time period. Groups were categorized as small, medium or large for analysis. The baboons spent most of their time on the floor and the bench and this pattern did not change with the addition of the new structures. The female baboons used the new structures an average of 16.5 per cent of the observation time, the males used them 13.6 per cent of the time, and the infants used them 10.1 per cent of the time. Of the new structures, males, females and infants all used the ladder the most. Females and infants used areas that were inaccessible to males and no group size differences were found.},

Reflecting on both theoretical disagreements (animal protectionists vs. wildlife conservationists) and practical challenges (the small percentage of endangered species actually exhibited in zoos, disappointing success of reintroduction programs), the paper explains why the 'Noah's Ark' paradigm is being replaced by an alternative 'integrated approach.' It explores the changes in the zoo's core tasks that the new paradigm implies. And it pays special attention to the changes that would have to be made in zoos' collection policies: connection with in situ projects, emphasizing local species and the local biogeographical region, exchange of animals among zoos and between zoos and wildlife, and a shift towards smaller species. Finally the question will be addressed whether the new paradigm will achieve a morally acceptable balance between animal welfare costs and species conservation benefits.},

  abstract = {Genetically modified (or GM) plants have attracted a large amount of media attention in recent years and continue to do so. Despite this, the general public remains largely unaware of what a GM plant actually is or what advantages and disadvantages the technology has to offer, particularly with regard to the range of applications for which they can be used. From the first generation of GM crops, two main areas of concern have emerged, namely risk to the environment and risk to human health. As GM plants are gradually being introduced into the European Union there is likely to be increasing public concern regarding potential health issues. Although it is now commonplace for the press to adopt 'health campaigns', the information they publish is often unreliable and unrepresentative of the available scientific evidence. We consider it important that the medical profession should be aware of the state of the art, and, as they are often the first port of call for a concerned patient, be in a position to provide an informed opinion. This review will examine how GM plants may impact on human health both directly - through applications targeted at nutrition and enhancement of recombinant medicine production - but also indirectly, through potential effects on the environment. Finally, it will examine the most important opposition currently facing the worldwide adoption of this technology: public opinion.},

The dogs warned people of the presence of tiger. The responses of 40 dogs were recorded and verified and it was found that the dogs could detect the presence of any nearby sizeable wild animal with a success rate of 92\% but they could not always distinguish tiger from wild boar Sus scrofa or spotted deer Axis axis. Success rate in distinguishing the tiger was 62\%. The dogs were particularly useful for honey gatherers because when they smoke the honeycomb visibility becomes poor and they become more vulnerable to attack by tigers.},

  abstract = {The extraction and immunoassay of fecal steroids is an increasingly common technique, used in both captive and field studies to provide an approximation of an animal’s circulating concentration of hormones through non-invasive methods. Storage of fecal samples is of critical concern because fecal bacteria metabolize fecal steroids within hours after deposit. Ethanol is often used as a preservative for fecal samples stored for several hours at room temperature. We examined the stability of fecal estrogen (fE) and glucocorticoid (fGC) metabolites from baboon (Papio cynocephalus) samples in a 95\% ethanol solution at ambient temperature and at −20 °C over the course of six months, to determine the effect of storage on steroid concentrations. As measured by radioimmunoassay, fE metabolite concentrations increased by 122\% at 90 days and fGC metabolite concentrations increased by 92\% at 120 days. After peaking, both hormones declined to near initial concentrations by 180 days in ambient temperature samples. In samples stored at sub-zero temperatures, fGC metabolite concentrations showed a similar but dampened pattern, while fE metabolite concentrations exhibited small and variable changes with no consistent trend. We discuss explanations for the dynamic pattern of changing fecal metabolite concentrations and offer practical and analytical guidance to field workers for situations in which ideal conditions for stabilizing hormones are not available.},

This study aimed to reveal retrospectively the clinical features of enteritis and factors contributing to its high occurrence. In addition, haematological and serum biochemical parameters in kangaroos younger than 24 months were analyzed. The findings suggested that enteritis occurrence was higher in 10- to 12-month-old kangaroos than other ages and during seasons with high temperature and humidity than during seasons with low temperature and humidity. The haematological and serum biochemical analyses showed decreases in glucose, total cholesterol, calcium, and triglyceride levels at approximately 10 months of age. Joeys emerge from their mother's pouch at 8 months of age and permanently leave it at approximately 10 months of age. Subsequently, the joeys are exposed to the external environment and infectious agents. Although the joeys continue suckling until 13–19 months of age, the joeys start to eat the similar feed to the adult and their nutritional status may change at approximately 10 months of age. Seasonal influences, species behavior, and shifts in dietary composition are proposed to be contributory to the increased occurrence of enteritis between 10 and 12 months of age.},

  abstract = {Naegleria fowleri is a ubiquitous, pathogenic free-living amoeba; it is the most virulent Naegleria species and causes primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAME) in laboratory animals and humans. Although amphotericin B is currently the only agent available for the treatment of PAME, it is a very toxic antibiotic and may cause many adverse effects on other organs. In order to find other potentially therapeutic agents for N. fowleri infection, the present study was undertaken to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo efficacies of miltefosine and chlorpromazine against pathogenic N. fowleri. The result showed that the growth of the amoeba was effectively inhibited by treatment with amphotericin B, miltefosine, and chlorpromazine. When N. fowleri trophozoites were treated with amphotericin B, miltefosine, and chlorpromazine, the MICs of the drug were 0.78, 25, and 12.5 microg/ml, respectively, on day 2. In experimental meningoencephalitis of mice that is caused by N. fowleri, the survival rates of mice treated with amphotericin B, miltefosine, and chlorpromazine were 40, 55, and 75\%, respectively, during 1 month. The average mean time to death for the amphotericin B, miltefosine, and chlorpromazine treatments was 17.9 days. In this study, the effect of drugs was found to be optimal when 20 mg/kg was administered three times on days 3, 7, and 11. Finally, chlorpromazine had the best therapeutic activity against N. fowleri in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, it may be a more useful therapeutic agent for the treatment of PAME than amphotericin B.},

  abstract = {Typically, animal phobias develop during childhood and persist for many years. The onset of childhood animal phobias is a perplexing theoretical issue. According to Rachman's influential three pathways theory, phobia onset is due to direct conditioning, modelling or instruction/information. Our review shows some empirical support for Rachman's three pathways theory in relation to the aetiology of childhood animal phobias. We also review laboratory investigations of attentional bias, which is considered to play a role in the maintenance of childhood animal phobias. Several clinical assessment procedures are outlined: structured diagnostic interviews, fear survey schedules for children, behavioural avoidance tests, self-monitoring and psychophysiological recording. Cognitive-behavioural interventions appear to be effective in the treatment of animal phobias displayed by children. However, further controlled research must be conducted before we can claim to have really clinically efficacious interventions for animal phobic children.

  title = {Why Propensity Score Should Not Be Used for Matching},
  author = {King, Gary and Nielsen, Richard},
  date = {2016},
  abstract = {We show that propensity score matching (PSM), an enormously popular method of preprocessing data for causal inference, often accomplishes the opposite of its in- tended goal—increasing imbalance, inefficiency, model dependence, and bias. PSM supposedly makes it easier to find matches by projecting a large number of covari- ates to a scalar propensity score and applying a single model to produce an unbiased estimate. However, in observational analysis the data generation process is rarely known and so users typically try many models before choosing one to present. The weakness of PSM comes from its attempts to approximate a completely random- ized experiment, rather than, as with other matching methods, a more efficient fully blocked randomized experiment. PSM is thus uniquely blind to the often large por- tion of imbalance that can be eliminated by approximating full blocking with other matching methods. Moreover, in data balanced enough to approximate complete randomization, either to begin with or after pruning some observations, PSM ap- proximates random matching which, we show, increases imbalance even relative to the original data. Although these results suggest that researchers replace PSM with one of the other available methods when performing matching, propensity scores have many other productive uses.},

DATA SOURCES: Original studies for inclusion were identified through keyword searches in ISI Web of Knowledge, Google Scholar, EconLit, and AgEcon Search. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Studies were included when they build on primary data from farm surveys or field trials anywhere in the world, and when they report impacts of GM soybean, maize, or cotton on crop yields, pesticide use, and/or farmer profits. In total, 147 original studies were included. SYNTHESIS METHODS: Analysis of mean impacts and meta-regressions to examine factors that influence outcomes. RESULTS: On average, GM technology adoption has reduced chemical pesticide use by 37\%, increased crop yields by 22\%, and increased farmer profits by 68\%. Yield gains and pesticide reductions are larger for insect-resistant crops than for herbicide-tolerant crops. Yield and profit gains are higher in developing countries than in developed countries. LIMITATIONS: Several of the original studies did not report sample sizes and measures of variance. CONCLUSION: The meta-analysis reveals robust evidence of GM crop benefits for farmers in developed and developing countries. Such evidence may help to gradually increase public trust in this technology.},

In total, 147 original studies were included. SYNTHESIS METHODS: Analysis of mean impacts and meta-regressions to examine factors that influence outcomes. RESULTS: On average, GM technology adoption has reduced chemical pesticide use by 37\%, increased crop yields by 22\%, and increased farmer profits by 68\%. Yield gains and pesticide reductions are larger for insect-resistant crops than for herbicide-tolerant crops. Yield and profit gains are higher in developing countries than in developed countries. LIMITATIONS: Several of the original studies did not report sample sizes and measures of variance. CONCLUSION: The meta-analysis reveals robust evidence of GM crop benefits for farmers in developed and developing countries. Such evidence may help to gradually increase public trust in this technology.},

  abstract = {An animal's response to a stressor is to increase metabolic rate, and thus energy consumption through the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Changes to energy use by an animal are likely to influence the efficiency with which it is utilised. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that less efficient sheep are more responsive to exogenous administration of adrenocorticotropin hormone. This was done by firstly determining the appropriate dose (0.4, 1.6 or 6.4 μg/kg LW) and peak serum cortisol response time (45 min) to exogenous administration of adrenocorticotropin hormone in a pilot study (n = 3 sheep). Following this, adrenocorticotropin hormone (2.0 μg/kg LW) stimulated cortisol levels were measured in a larger group of sheep (n = 50) of known feed efficiency (feed conversion ratio and residual feed intake values). Less efficient sheep (more positive residual feed intake values) were found to have a greater (P {$<$} 0.001) increase in cortisol concentration in comparison to more efficient animals. Those sheep which had higher levels of cortisol also had a greater proportion (P {$<$} 0.001) of fat tissue. These data clearly demonstrated that efficiency of energy use, when measured as residual feed intake, is significantly related to an animal's stress response. These findings have important implications for understanding the physiological mechanisms underpinning efficiency of energy use, and may be useful in successfully identifying animals which are superior in terms of feed efficiency.

  abstract = {I did the food habits of the Asiatic black bear Ursus thibetanus from 1013 fecal samples collected between 1999 and 2005 in the Misaka Mountains on the Pacific coast of central Japan. The food habits of the bears showed clear seasonal changes, and I classified the food resources of the bears into three types. Staple foods were green vegetation in spring, soft mast (Prunus spp.) and insects in summer, and hard mast (Quercus spp.) in autumn. Alternative foods were green vegetation and other soft mast (Rubus spp.) in summer and Japanese chestnuts Castanea crenata and vine fruits in autumn. Foods of opportunity were hard mast (Quercus spp.) that had been shed in the previous autumn and were found in spring and other fruits in autumn. Seasonal food habits showed yearly variations: bears used alternative foods and foods of opportunity in response to the yearly variation in staple food amount, but the magnitude of variability of food habits differed among seasons, with large variability in autumn and small variability in summer and spring. The primary influence on the yearly variation in food habit is presumably the fluctuation in fruit production among years. Summer is probably the most difficult season in terms of the bear's food supply, because the number of fruiting species is limited and staple foods such as new green vegetation and fruits are less available. Long-term studies of the availability of the main food items and food habits of bears will be critical for further understanding these animals' feeding ecology and for determining the factors that influence their behavior. ?? 2009 Deutsche Gesellschaft f??r S??ugetierkunde.},

  abstract = {Previously developed models of reproductive skew have overlooked one of the main reasons why subordinates might remain in a group despite restricted opportunities to breed: the possibility of social queuing, i.e. acquiring dominant status in the future. Here, we present a dynamic ESS model of skew in animal societies that incorporates both immediate and future fitness consequences of the decisions taken by group members, based on their probability of surviving from one season to the next (when post-breeding survival probabilities drop to zero, our analysis reduces to the model produced by Reeve and Ratnieks in 1993, which considered only a single breeding season). This allows us to compare the delayed benefits of philopatry and the immediate opportunities for independent breeding. We show that delayed benefits greatly reduce the need for dominants to offer reproductive concessions to retain subordinates peacefully in the group. Moreover, this effect is strong enough that differences in survival have a much greater impact on the group structure than differences in other parameters, such as relatedness. When the possibility of acceding to dominant status is taken into account, groups where the dominant completely monopolizes reproduction can be stable, even if they consist of unrelated individuals, and even if subordinates have a reasonably high probability of winning a fight for dominance. Finally, we show that stable groups are possible even if association leads to a decrease in current productivity. Subordinates may still stand to gain from group membership under these circumstances, as acquiring breeding positions by queuing may be more efficient than the attempt to establish a new territory. At the same time, the dominant may be unable to exclude unwelcome subordinates, may enjoy increased survival when they are present, or may gain indirect benefits from allowing relatives to stay and queue for dominance. We conclude that reproductive skew in animal groups, ranging from eusocial insect colonies to mating aggregations (leks), will be strongly influenced by the future prospects of group members.},

However, not all interventions can be assessed with an RCT, whereas for many interventions trials can be prohibitively expensive. In addition, even well designed RCTs can be susceptible to systematic errors leading to biased estimates, particularly when generalising results to “real world” settings. For example, the external validity of clinical trials in diabetes seems to be poor; the proportion of the Scottish population that met eligibility criteria for seven major clinical trials ranged from 3.5\% to 50.7\%.1 One of the greatest concerns is patients with multimorbidity, who are commonly excluded from RCTs.2\textbackslash n\textbackslash nObservational studies can address some of these shortcomings, but the lack of researcher control over confounding variables and the difficulty in establishing causation mean that conclusions from studies using observational approaches are generally considered to be weaker.

Studies in feral populations indicate the existence of a proactive and a reactive coping style. These coping styles seem to play a role in the population ecology of the species. Despite domestication, genetic selection and inbreeding, the same coping styles can, to some extent, also be observed in laboratory and farm animals. Coping styles are characterized by consistent behavioral and neuroendocrine characteristics, some of which seem to be causally linked to each other. Evidence is accumulating that the two coping styles might explain a differential vulnerability to stress mediated disease due to the differential adaptive value of the two coping styles and the accompanying neuroendocrine differentiation.},

The use of the term 'stress' to conditions ranging from even the mildest challenging stimulation to severely aversive conditions, is in our view inappropriate. Review of the literature reveals that the physiological 'stress' response to appetitive, rewarding stimuli that are often not considered to be stressors can be as large as the response to negative stimuli. Analysis of the physiological response during exercise supports the view that the magnitude of the neuroendocrine response reflects the metabolic and physiological demands required for behavioural activity. We propose that the term 'stress' should be restricted to conditions where an environmental demand exceeds the natural regulatory capacity of an organism, in particular situations that include unpredictability and uncontrollability. Physiologically, stress seems to be characterized by either the absence of an anticipatory response (unpredictable) or a reduced recovery (uncontrollable) of the neuroendocrine reaction. The consequences of this restricted definition for stress research and the interpretation of results in terms of the adaptive and/or maladaptive nature of the response are discussed.},

We develop and apply multilevel, multinomial logistic regression models for analyzing such data. These statistical methods correspond to the multinomial character of the response variable while also accounting for the repeated observations of individuals that characterize behavioral datasets. Correlated random effects potentially reveal individual-level trade-offs across behaviors, allowing for models that reveal the extent to which individuals who regularly engage in one behavior also exhibit relatively more or less of another behavior. Using an example dataset, we demonstrate the estimation of these models using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithms, as implemented in the RStan package in the R statistical environment. The supplemental files include a coding script and data that demonstrate auxiliary functions to prepare the data, estimate the models, summarize the posterior samples, and generate figures that display model predictions. We discuss possible extensions to our approach, including models with random slopes to allow individual-level behavioral strategies to vary over time and the need for models that account for temporal autocorrelation. These models can potentially be applied to a broad class of statistical analyses by behavioral ecologists, focusing on other polytomous response variables, such as behavior, habitat choice, or emotional states.},

Fifty‐nine untrained student/interviewers conducted eight interviews each and were randomly assigned to a control, feedback or feedback and reflection group. Compared to the control group, the groups receiving feedback used a higher percentage of recommended questions and retrieved more relevant details while using a lower percentage of not recommended questions and retrieved less wrong details. Only the groups that received feedback reached a reliable change in the proportion of recommended questions. The reflection intervention proposed in the present study did not enhance training effects above and beyond feedback in the present sample. The present study replicated previous findings regarding the role of feedback in improving the quality of investigative interviews, however, failing to show an effect of reflection. Further studies on different reflection tasks are suggested.Copyright © 2017 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

For layer pullets no regulation of stocking density has been established yet. Based on the existing Council Directives for laying hens (1999/74/EC), broiler chickens (2007/43/EC) and calculations of the floor space that is required for the respective chicken\&rsquo;s body, we exemplarily calculated maximum stocking densities for layer pullets. Based on the calculations we obtained absolute additional spaces for birds of different live body mass classes, i.e., useable floor space that the birds have additionally available to the space covered by their body. This allowed us to calculate the relative additional space per individual. We suggest the relative additional space to be a key parameter to derive requirements for a maximum stocking density in layer pullets. We analysed several scenarios for pullets under consideration of the Council Directives for laying hens and for broiler chickens, coming to the conclusion that layer pullets at the end of their rearing period should be provided ideally with a relative additional space of about 40\&ndash;60\%.},

In April 2014 we launched a program of nine courses, the Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization, which has now had more than 4 million enrollments over the past three years. Here the program is described and compared to both standard and more recently developed data science curricula. We show that novel pedagogical and administrative decisions introduced in our program are now standard in online data science programs.

  abstract = {To control both fasting and prandial plasma glucose levels in people with diabetes, insulin therapy must mimic "normal" physiological insulin secretion as much as possible. This is achieved with a long-acting insulin injected once or twice daily and a bolus of insulin injected before every meal. Prandial (bolus) insulin can either be regular human insulin (RHI) or a rapid-acting insulin analogue (RAIA). Although the efficacy of RHI has been established over approximately 35 years of clinical use, RAIAs offer several clinical advantages over RHI, namely that they have been engineered with a reduced tendency to aggregate as hexamers, which allows for rapid dissociation and absorption after a subcutaneous injection. Conventional RAIAs include insulin lispro, insulin aspart, and insulin glulisine. The more recently developed fast-acting insulin aspart (faster aspart) is an ultrafast-acting mealtime insulin that contains the conventional insulin aspart in a new formulation with the excipients niacinamide and L-arginine to achieve faster insulin absorption than RHI and the conventional insulin aspart formulation. This article reviews the clinical evidence supporting the use of RAIAs as part of a basal-bolus regimen in patients with diabetes, with a focus on new formulations whose pharmacological profiles more closely mimic the endogenous prandial insulin secretion pattern that is seen in individuals without diabetes. This review also provides a clinical perspective to help guide health care professionals in the use of RAIAs.},

Forty-three cats were studied either with a BC SPCA Hide \& Perch™ box as enrichment, or with an open bed as control. Observations consisted of Stress Score, approach test and scan sample, recorded daily over the five days following a cat's entrance into the adoption centre, and again on the 14th day if the cat was still present. Days until adoption was noted for cats adopted during the study period. A survey was given to adopters of study cats in an attempt to determine the motivations underlying their choice of cat. A significant reduction in stress was noted between all study days in the enriched group. Stress levels in this group declined further between the fifth and the 14th day, while those of the control group increased. Cats in the enriched group were significantly more likely to approach and displayed relaxed behaviours much more frequently. No significant difference was found between the two groups in days until adoption, percentage adopted, or in the reasons provided by the new owners in the adoption survey; however temperament was found to be the highest ranked reason for choosing a cat from either group. Results of this study suggest that the welfare of kennelled cats is greatly improved if they are provided with the opportunity to perform effective hiding behaviour, and that the ability to perform such a behaviour does not decrease the likelihood of those cats being adopted.},

One of the ultimate aims of ex situ conservation is reintroduction of endangered animals into their natural habitats while maintaining 90 \% of the founder genetic diversity. Advances in molecular genetics and microsatellite genotyping techniques make it possible to accurately estimate genetic diversity of captive animals of unknown ancestry. Here we assess genetic diversity of the red panda population in Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park, Darjeeling, which plays a pivotal role in ex situ conservation of red panda in India. We generated microsatellite genotypes of fifteen red pandas with a set of fourteen loci. This population is genetically diverse with 68 \% observed heterozygosity (HO) and mean inbreeding (FIS) coefficient of 0.05. However population viability analysis reveals that this population has a very low survival probability ({$<$}2 \%) and will rapidly loose its genetic diversity to 37 \% mainly due to small population size and skewed male-biased sex ratio. Regular supplementation with a pair of adult individuals every five years will increase survival probability and genetic diversity to 99 and 61 \% respectively and will also support future harvesting of individuals for reintroduction into the wild and exchange with other zoos.},

  abstract = {Lyme disease is a tick-transmitted disease caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. The bacterium adopts different strategies for its survival inside the immunocompetent host from the time of infection until dissemination in different parts of body tissues. The success of this spirochete depends on its ability to colonise the host tissues and counteract the host's defence mechanisms. During this process borrelia seems to maintain its vitality to ensure long-term survival in the host. Borrelia's proteins are encoded by plasmid and chromosomal genes. These genes are differentially regulated and expressed by different environmental factors in ticks as well as in the mammalian host during infection. In addition, antigenic diversity enables the spirochete to escape host defence mechanisms and maintain infection. In this review we focus on the differential expression of proteins and genes, and further molecular mechanisms used by borrelia to maintain its survival in the host. In light of these pathogenetic mechanisms, further studies on spirochete host interaction are needed to understand the complex interplay that finally lead to host autoimmunity.},

  abstract = {In the last decade, Internet usage has grown tremendously on a global scale. The increasing popularity and frequency of Internet use has led to an increasing number of reports highlighting the potential negative consequences of overuse. Over the last decade, research into Internet addiction has proliferated. This paper reviews the existing 68 epidemiological studies of Internet addiction that (i) contain quantitative empirical data, (ii) have been published after 2000, (iii) include an analysis relating to Internet addiction, (iv) include a minimum of 1000 participants, and (v) provide a full-text article published in English using the database Web of Science. Assessment tools and conceptualisations, prevalence, and associated factors in adolescents and adults are scrutinised. The results reveal the following. First, no gold standard of Internet addiction classification exists as 21 different assessment instruments have been identified. They adopt official criteria for substance use disorders or pathological gambling, no or few criteria relevant for an addiction diagnosis, time spent online, or resulting problems. Second, reported prevalence rates differ as a consequence of different assessment tools and cut-offs, ranging from 0.8\% in Italy to 26.7\% in Hong Kong. Third, Internet addiction is associated with a number of sociodemographic, Internet use, and psychosocial factors, as well as comorbid symptoms and disorder in adolescents and adults. The results indicate that a number of core symptoms (i.e., compulsive use, negative outcomes and salience) appear relevant for diagnosis, which assimilates Internet addiction and other addictive disorders and also differentiates them, implying a conceptualisation as syndrome with similar etiology and components, but different expressions of addictions. Limitations include the exclusion of studies with smaller sample sizes and studies focusing on specific online behaviours. Conclusively, there is a need for nosological precision so that ultimately those in need can be helped by translating the scientific evidence established in the context of Internet addiction into actual clinical practice.},

  abstract = {As wildlife populations become smaller, the number of interacting stochastic processes which can destabilize the populations increases: genetic effects (inbreeding and loss of adaptability) and instability of the breeding structure (sex ratio imbalances, unstable age distribution, and disrupted social systems) can decrease population growth and stability. Recent analyses have shown that some populations can be very sensitive to these stochastic processes, at larger population sizes than had been suggested previously, and often in unexpected ways. Interactions among processes can reduce population viability much more so than would be assumed from consideration of isolated factors. For example, in monogamous species, random fluctuations in sex ratio will depress the mean number of breeding pairs in populations with as many as 500 adults. At low population densities, individuals may not be able to find mates, or may not encounter individuals sufficiently unrelated to be accepted as suitable mates. Inbreeding depression of demographic rates can become a significant contributor to population decline in populations with several hundred individuals, even if genetic problems are not the primary threat. Most models of genetic decay in small and fragmented populations assume demographic stability. However, when the increases in demographic fluctuations of small populations are considered, rates of loss of genetic variation and accumulation of inbreeding can be much faster than has been suggested before. These processes can be examined in detailed, individual-based PVA models. Accurate data to parameterize these models, however, are often not available. Thus, we need to interpret cautiously PVA conclusions for populations that are small, highly fragmented, or projected for many generations.},

  abstract = {Individuals affected with developmental disorders of speech and language have substantial difficulty acquiring expressive and/or receptive language in the absence of any profound sensory or neurological impairment and despite adequate intelligence and opportunity. Although studies of twins consistently indicate that a significant genetic component is involved, most families segregating speech and language deficits show complex patterns of inheritance, and a gene that predisposes individuals to such disorders has not been identified. We have studied a unique three-generation pedigree, KE, in which a severe speech and language disorder is transmitted as an autosomal-dominant monogenic trait. Our previous work mapped the locus responsible, SPCH1, to a 5.6-cM interval of region 7q31 on chromosome 7 (ref. 5). We also identified an unrelated individual, CS, in whom speech and language impairment is associated with a chromosomal translocation involving the SPCH1 interval. Here we show that the gene FOXP2, which encodes a putative transcription factor containing a polyglutamine tract and a forkhead DNA-binding domain, is directly disrupted by the translocation breakpoint in CS. In addition, we identify a point mutation in affected members of the KE family that alters an invariant amino-acid residue in the forkhead domain. Our findings suggest that FOXP2 is involved in the developmental process that culminates in speech and language.},

  abstract = {Individuals affected with developmental disorders of speech and language have substantial difficulty acquiring expressive and/or receptive language in the absence of any profound sensory or neurological impairment and despite adequate intelligence and opportunity. Although studies of twins consistently indicate that a significant genetic component is involved, most families segregating speech and language deficits show complex patterns of inheritance, and a gene that predisposes individuals to such disorders has not been identified. We have studied a unique three-generation pedigree, KE, in which a severe speech and language disorder is transmitted as an autosomal-dominant monogenic trait. Our previous work mapped the locus responsible, SPCH1, to a 5.6-cM interval of region 7q31 on chromosome 7 (ref. 5). We also identified an unrelated individual, CS, in whom speech and language impairment is associated with a chromosomal translocation involving the SPCH1 interval. Here we show that the gene FOXP2, which encodes a putative transcription factor containing a polyglutamine tract and a forkhead DNA-binding domain, is directly disrupted by the translocation breakpoint in CS. In addition, we identify a point mutation in affected members of the KE family that alters an invariant amino-acid residue in the forkhead domain. Our findings suggest that FOXP2 is involved in the developmental process that culminates in speech and language.},

For scientists themselves, effect sizes are most useful because they facilitate cumulative science. Effect sizes can be used to determine the sample size for follow-up studies, or examining effects across studies. This article aims to provide a practical primer on how to calculate and report effect sizes for t-tests and ANOVA's such that effect sizes can be used in a-priori power analyses and meta-analyses. Whereas many articles about effect sizes focus on between-subjects designs and address within-subjects designs only briefly, I provide a detailed overview of the similarities and differences between within- and between-subjects designs. I suggest that some research questions in experimental psychology examine inherently intra-individual effects, which makes effect sizes that incorporate the correlation between measures the best summary of the results. Finally, a supplementary spreadsheet is provided to make it as easy as possible for researchers to incorporate effect size calculations into their workflow.},

  abstract = {Behavioral research within zoological institutions (zoos and aquariums) has a long history that has helped to increase basic scientific knowledge and to facilitate the ability of institutions to make informed animal management decisions. Kleiman (1992) stated that "behavior research in zoos has enormous potential to contribute positively to the science of animal management, long-term breeding programs, conservation biology, and the advancement of scientific theory" (p. 309). As evidenced by the papers in this issue, behavioral research in zoos continues to be important. The purpose of this special issue is to highlight some of the behavioral research being conducted within zoos and aquariums and to demonstrate the importance of such work to zoological institutions and the greater scientific community. With a better understanding of the importance of behavioral research, we hope to inspire more zoological facilities to become involved either through funding/ conducting research or by actively promoting the use of their animal collections for behavioral research to both the zoological and academic communities. Historically, most of the behavioral research in zoos and aquariums was intended to increase basic scientific knowledge. More recently, there has been a shift in focus to applied topics in order to help solve animal management issues (Hutchins \& Thompson, 2008; Kleiman, 1992; Stoinski, Lukas, \& Maple, 1998). Such issues range from reproduction and behavioral development of species that are difficult to breed to determining the effects of environmental or management factors on the welfare of individual or groups of animals. The abstracts submitted for consideration for this special issue reflect this trend towards applied research in zoos and aquariums. Applied research represented approximately 76\% (n = 50) of the abstracts that were submitted for the special issue. While not necessarily},

  abstract = {Tail biting in pigs is an animal welfare problem, and tail biting should be prevented from developing into tail damage. One strategy could be to predict events of tail biting so that the farmer can make timely interventions in specific pens. In the current investigation, sensor data on water usage (water flow and activation frequency) and pen temperature (above solid and slatted floor) were included in the development of a prediction algorithm for tail biting. Steps in the development included modelling of data sources with dynamic linear models, optimisation and training of artificial neural networks and combining predictions of the single data sources with a Bayesian ensemble strategy. Lastly, the Bayesian ensemble combination was tested on a separate batch of finisher pigs in a real-life setting. The final prediction algorithm had an AUC \&gt; 0.80, and thus it does seem possible to predict events of tail biting from already available sensor data. However, around 30\% of the no-event days were false alarms, and more event-specific predictors are needed. Thus, it was suggested that farmers could use the alarms to point out pens that need greater attention.},

Analyzed the results of treatment of 89 elderly patients (65-74 years) who, according to similar emergency indications, underwent surgery and postoperatively showed signs of delirium (according to the DDS scale ≥8 points). Depending on the treatment regimen, the patients were divided into three groups: in the first (n=32) group, bromodihydrochlorophenylbenzodiazepine was administered intravenously (1-5 min) in a dose of 1 mg in the 1st group (n=32) to the group (patients of the 2nd group (n=28) with the same purpose and at the same time cytoflavin was injected: 10 ml of the drug in dilution per 200 ml of 10\% glucose solution intravenously at a rate of 140 drops (7 ml) per minute. Patients of 3rd group (n=29) were injected with ethylmethylhydroxypyridine succinate intravenous (within 5-7 min) at a dose of 200 mg. The condition was assessed using the SOFA, DDS and RASS scales. The inclusion of drugs with antioxidant/membrane-protective action (Cytoflavin and ethylmethylhydroxypyridine succinate) in the treatment regimen of postoperative delirium in the elderly increases the effectiveness of treatment, which is manifested in more rapid relief of the condition. When comparing the efficacy of Cytoflavin and ethylmethylhydroxypyridine succinate, it was noted that in a number of indicators (restoration of spontaneous breathing, improvement after the first dose and complete relief of signs of delirium) both drugs showed comparable results, however, when assessing the depth of sedation (on the RASS scale), Cytoflavin was more effective (p=0,001).The obtained results of the effectiveness of cytoflavin in combination with good patient tolerance allows us to recommend the inclusion of the drug in the treatment regimens of this pathology.},

We hypothesized that people with higher trait exploration experience a greater increase in lifestyle options and learning opportunities--but more so in social ecologies in which individualization and lifelong learning are stronger, thus offering greater latitude for exploring the benefits of these trends. We employed structural equation modeling in two parallel adult samples from Germany (N=2,448) and Poland (N=2,571), using regional divorce rates as a proxy for individualization and Internet domain registration rates as a proxy for lifelong learning. Higher exploration was related to a greater perceived increase in lifestyle options and in learning opportunities over the past 5 years. These associations were stronger in regions in which the trends toward individualization and lifelong learning, respectively, were more prominent. Individuals higher in exploration are better equipped to reap the benefits of current social change--but the effects of exploration are bounded by the conditions in the social ecology.},

As the tools and technology embedded in social networking sites change, and use of the sites continues to grow, youth may be exchanging "macro blogging" for microblogging with status updates. Blogging has declined in popularity among both teens and young adults since 2006. Blog commenting has also dropped among teens. This report brings together recent findings about internet and social media use among young adults by situating it within comparable data for adolescents and adults older than 30. All the most current data on teens is drawn from a survey the authors conducted between June 26 and September 24, 2009 of 800 adolescents between ages 12 and 17. Most of the adult data are drawn from a survey they conducted between August 18 and September 14, 2009 of 2,253 adults (age 18 and over). (Contains 2 tables and 13 footnotes.)},

  abstract = {Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are commonly used to model animal movement data and infer aspects of animal behavior. An HMM assumes that each data point from a time series of observations stems from one of \$N\$ possible states. The states are loosely connected to behavioral modes that manifest themselves at the temporal resolution at which observations are made. However, due to advances in tag technology, data can be collected at increasingly fine temporal resolutions. Yet, inferences at time scales cruder than those at which data are collected, and which correspond to larger-scale behavioral processes, are not yet answered via HMMs. We include additional hierarchical structures to the basic HMM framework in order to incorporate multiple Markov chains at various time scales. The hierarchically structured HMMs allow for behavioral inferences at multiple time scales and can also serve as a means to avoid coarsening data. Our proposed framework is one of the first that models animal behavior simultaneously at multiple time scales, opening new possibilities in the area of animal movement modeling. We illustrate the application of hierarchically structured HMMs in two real-data examples: (i) vertical movements of harbor porpoises observed in the field, and (ii) garter snake movement data collected as part of an experimental design.},

Here, we show that through engineering hydrogel materials to promote alpha3/alpha5beta1 integrin binding, we can promote the formation of a space-filling and mature vasculature compared with hydrogel materials that promote alphavbeta3 integrin binding. In vitro, alpha3/alpha5beta1 scaffolds promoted endothelial cells to sprout and branch, forming organized extensive networks that eventually reached and anastomosed with neighbouring branches. In vivo, alpha3/alpha5beta1 scaffolds delivering vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) promoted non-tortuous blood vessel formation and non-leaky blood vessels by 10 days post-stroke. In contrast, materials that promote alphavbeta3 integrin binding promoted endothelial sprout clumping in vitro and leaky vessels in vivo. This work shows that precisely controlled integrin activation from a biomaterial can be harnessed to direct therapeutic vessel regeneration and reduce VEGF-induced vascular permeability in vivo.},

  abstract = {Land-use regression (LUR) models have been developed to estimate spatial distributions of traffic-related pollutants. Several studies have examined spatial autocorrelation among residuals in LUR models, but few utilized spatial residual information in model prediction, or examined the impact of modeling methods, monitoring site selection, or traffic data quality on LUR performance. This study aims to improve spatial models for traffic-related pollutants using generalized additive models (GAM) combined with cokriging of spatial residuals. Specifically, we developed spatial models for nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) and nitrogen oxides (NO(x)) concentrations in Southern California separately for two seasons (summer and winter) based on over 240 sampling locations. Pollutant concentrations were disaggregated into three components: local means, spatial residuals, and normal random residuals. Local means were modeled by GAM. Spatial residuals were cokriged with global residuals at nearby sampling locations that were spatially auto-correlated. We compared this two-stage approach with four commonly-used spatial models: universal kriging, multiple linear LUR and GAM with and without a spatial smoothing term. Leave-one-out cross validation was conducted for model validation and comparison purposes. The results show that our GAM plus cokriging models predicted summer and winter NO(2) and NO(x) concentration surfaces well, with cross validation R(2) values ranging from 0.88 to 0.92. While local covariates accounted for partial variance of the measured NO(2) and NO(x) concentrations, spatial autocorrelation accounted for about 20\% of the variance. Our spatial GAM model improved R(2) considerably compared to the other four approaches. Conclusively, our two-stage model captured summer and winter differences in NO(2) and NO(x) spatial distributions in Southern California well. When sampling location selection cannot be optimized for the intended model and fewer covariates are available as predictors for the model, the two-stage model is more robust compared to multiple linear regression models.},

  abstract = {I have taken an experimental approach to this question. Freely voluntary acts are pre- ceded by a specific electrical change in the brain (the ‘readiness potential’, RP) that begins 550 ms before the act. Human subjects became aware of intention to act 350–400 ms after RP starts, but 200 ms. before the motor act. The volitional process is therefore initiated unconsciously. But the conscious function could still control the outcome; it can veto the act. Free will is therefore not excluded. These findings put constraints on views of how free will may operate; it would not initiate a voluntary act but it could control performance of the act. The findings also affect views of guilt and responsibility. But the deeper question still remains: Are freely voluntary acts subject to macro- deterministic laws or can they appear without such constraints, non-determined by natural laws and ‘truly free’? I shall present an experimentalist view about these fundamental philosophical opposites.},

The sample was 1,289 adolescents from eleven senior high schools in Taiwan. Participants were asked about their perception of being monitored by their parents, leisure boredom, leisure activities, and Internet addiction behavior. Results showed that leisure boredom and involvement in Internet and social activities increase the probability of Internet addiction; however, family and outdoor activities along with participative and supportive parental monitoring decrease these tendencies. Overall evidence suggests that parental monitoring is a major inhibitor of Internet addiction. Thus, adolescents should be supervised in their daily routines and encouraged to participate in family and outdoor activities. In addition, adolescents should develop a positive attitude toward leisure and the skills to prevent overdependence on online relationships with the assistance of parents. These findings suggest the preventive strategies regarding Internet addiction.},

One obstacle remains for ecologists and wildlife biologists, namely the near absence of Bayesian texts written specifically for them.

  abstract = {I suggest that a conservation crisis is a predictable sequence of five stages: population decline, crisis management, stabilization, precarious recovery, and sustained recovery. Each stage has different research priorities, constraints, and opportunities that cause a mismatch between conservation needs and research practice. The conservation crisis over the rhinoceros was characterized by rapid decline due to illegal hunting and trade in rhinoceros horn. I conducted a literature review (1980-2000) on rhinoceros during this crisis to illustrate the five stages. I also examined the bibliographies of the African and Asian conservation action plans to illustrate literature availability and use. I sought to determine whether a retrospective understanding of trends in the scientific literature during conservation crises could help us better target research efforts and meet the challenge of conserving rare species. The scientific literature on rhinoceros increased during the crisis but became dominated by ex situ laboratory-based studies, whereas the number of in situ ecological studies remained low, although the conservation action plans identified in situ and ecological studies as conservation priorities. Moreover, the bibliographies of the conservation action plans were dominated by unpublished material (56\%), and only 25\% of citations came from scientific journals, although peer review and critique contributes to maintaining and improving the quality of conservation science. Thus, I suggest that research matched conservation needs poorly. However, the predictability of the crisis sequence means that it should be possible to preempt conservation research needs. The effect of a conservation crisis on research may be ameliorated by abandoning the dualism of applied and basic research and better targeting research effort by identifying when research is relatively unimportant, exploiting opportunities for science by management, establishing collaborative publishing relationships between managers and researchers, and prioritizing in situ ecological research.},

  abstract = {A group of Hanuman langurs (Presbytis entellus) was studied before and after it was moved from an old cage-style enclosure to a novel naturalistic environment at the London Zoo. Eating and locomotion occupied more of the langurs' time in their new enclosure, whereas dozing, allogrooming, and aggression decreased, along with an increase in inter-individual distances. These changes are attributed to the larger area, the stimulating new environment, and the langurs' increased distance from visitors. Nevertheless, the study raises questions about how to define standards of desirable environmental enrichment, as the activity patterns recorded in both the old and new enclosures are within the variation observed in the wild.},

As adults, the offspring of mothers that exhibited more licking and grooming of pups during the first 10 days of life showed reduced plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone and corticosterone responses to acute stress, increased hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor messenger RNA expression, enhanced glucocorticoid feedback sensitivity, and decreased levels of hypothalamic corticotropin- releasing hormone messenger RNA. Each measure was significantly, correlated with the frequency of maternal licking and grooming (all r's {$>$} -0.6). These findings suggest that maternal behavior serves to 'program' hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenal responses to stress in the offspring.},

  abstract = {Criticisms have recently been voiced of constructivism, the leading metaphor of human learning since the 1970s. Inspired by inconsistencies in interpretations of constructivism in current literature, we examine the underlying epistemological beliefs of popular constructivist theories and their criticisms. We find that popular constructivist claims and criticisms, instead of being based on contrasting philosophical ideas, are similarly grounded on the dualist separatism of the human mind and the external world. We then present our interpretation of Vygotsky’s historical-dialectical-monist philosophy, through discussions of Vygotskyan concepts including social environment of learning, the role of language, and individual consciousness. The paper concludes that confusions about Vygotsky’s theory often arise from concepts taken literally and from the lack of appreciation of the general philosophical orientation underpinning his works},

  abstract = {The efficacy of questionnaire-based personality assessment has been shown in a variety of animal and human personality studies. There has been a recent increase in questionnaire-based studies focussing on equine personality but with a lack of comparability to studies on other species. The aim of this study was to test the reliability of an assessment method originally developed for primates and demonstrate reliability using three criteria (1) assessments by independent observers must agree with one another, (2) these assessments must predict behaviours and real-world outcomes and (3) observer ratings must be shown to reflect genuine attributes of the individuals rated, not merely the observer's implicit personality theories about how traits co-vary. The personality of 61 horses (Equus caballus) was assessed using a questionnaire constructed of 30 behaviourally defined adjectives (BDAs). Horses were each assessed by three judges, in addition to a total of 2 h behaviour observations recorded per horse. Rater agreement was demonstrated for 72.1\% of the horses and 25 of the BDAs. Principal component analysis was carried out on the rating data and revealed six underlying personality components that were labelled "dominance", "anxiousness", "excitability", "protection", "sociability" and "inquisitiveness". Component scores for horses were correlated against behavioural observations for the same horses and revealed significant correlations with 20 of the recorded behaviour variables. Correlations between specific components and their associated behaviours were logical and consistent with the types of behaviours that would be expected to be linked with such personality types. The data were shown to meet all three criteria and provided strong evidence that the assessment method was reliably measuring horse personality. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The study of personality in animals has attracted considerable empirical attention beginning with Pavlovs identification of personality types in dogs. Subsequent work has revealed a number of similarities in personality between humans and nonhu- man animals. A number of personality traits that are typically identified in studies of human personality, including aspects of neuroticism and extraversion, have also been isolated in studies of animal personality, predominantly in studies of nonhuman primates. Even traits that might appear to be uniquely human such as conscientiousness and psychopathy have nonhuman parallels. Moreover, a number of personality traits in humans that have distinctive neurobiological signatures, particularly aspects of neuroticism, are identifiable in nonhuman primates. These similarities include low basal serotonin levels and elevated cortisol levels in response to stress. It is argued that the inclusion of personality assessments in studies of compara- tive cognition will identify sources of variance that affect cognitive functioning, and will identify mutual influences between personality and cognition.

We conclude that little information exists for any of these criteria and what is available is often inadequate to determine the frequency of attacks, their causes and how to avoid them. We suggest that information systems, including database(s) on attacks and encounters, should be established for large carnivore conservation efforts, to supply information and to answer future requests for this information.},

It is increasingly being used to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions ranging from clinical therapy to national public health legislation. Whereas the design shares many properties of regression-based approaches in other epidemiological studies, there are a range of unique features of time series data that require additional methodological considerations. In this tutorial we use a worked example to demonstrate a robust approach to ITS analysis using segmented regression. We begin by describing the design and considering when ITS is an appropriate design choice. We then discuss the essential, yet often omitted, step of proposing the impact model a priori. Subsequently, we demonstrate the approach to statistical analysis including the main segmented regression model. Finally we describe the main methodological issues associated with ITS analysis: over-dispersion of time series data, autocorrelation, adjusting for seasonal trends and controlling for time-varying confounders, and we also outline some of the more complex design adaptations that can be used to strengthen the basic ITS design.},

Like any vocalization, the acoustic character of the bark is likely to be a product of adaptation as well as an expression of the signaler's internal motivational state. While most authors recognize that the bark is a distinct signal type, no consistent description of its acoustic definition or function is apparent. The bark exhibits considerable variability in its acoustic form and occurs in a wide range of behavioral contexts, particularly in dogs. This has led some authors to suggest that dog barking might be a form of referential signaling, or an adaptation for heightened capability to communicate with humans. In this paper we propose a general 'canonical' acoustic description of the bark. Surveying relevant literature on dogs, wild canids, other mammals and birds, we explore an alternative functional hypothesis, first suggested by [Morton, E.S., 1977. On the occurrence and significance of motivation-structural rules in some bird and mammal sounds. Am. Nat. 111, 855-869] and consistent with his motivational-structural rules theory: that barking in many animals, including the domestic dog, is associated with mobbing behavior and the motivational states that accompany mobbing. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

  title = {Statistical Aspects of Using Genetic Markers for Individual Identification in Capture-Recapture Studies},
  author = {Lukacs, Paul M},
  date = {2005},
  abstract = {The use of an animal's genotype as a mark for capture-recapture studies has become increasingly common in wildlife research. Frequently, animals are sampled in a non-invasive way such as collecting hair from rubs, shed feathers or feces. DNA is extracted from the samples and genotyped at a set of microsatellite loci to identify individuals. In this case, the animal's mark is self assigned. This leads to problems with misidentification of individuals. In addition, samples are often passively collected which causes a break down in the standard capture-recapture assumption of instantaneous sampling. This dissertation focuses on developing new ways of handling the unique circumstances associated with DNA-based capture-recapture studies. I develop a method to account for genotyping error in closed population estimates of abundance. This method is used to extent the standard likelihood based closed population capture-recapture models, the finite mixture models and the conditional likelihood models. I extent the robust design model to properly estimate survival and abundance in the face of genotyping error and allows multiple sources of data to be brought together. A new method is developed that uses additional information in dung surveys generated from multiple detections of an individual within a sampling occasion to better estimate iv abundance. I present suggestions for applying DNA-based capture-recapture sampling for Canada lynx ( Lynx canadensis ) in Colorado. Sampling feces in winter appears to be the most effective way to sample the lynx population. Feces are easier to collect in the field than hair and are more amenable to DNA extraction. Finally, I present a review of the literature applicable to DNA-based capture-recapture studies. The focus of the review is to provide a starting point for researchers looking to broaden the scope of their DNA-based capture-recapture study beyond simple estimates of abundance.},

A continuous behavioral change sampling method was used to obtain information on behavior, and instantaneous scans at 10-min intervals provided information on the location of all gorillas in the focal group. An analysis of 226 h of behavioral data and 1386 map location scans showed enclosure rotation was associated with increased enclosure use and feeding and a decrease in self-directed behavior. Gorillas were more likely to increase exhibit use and visibility to zoo visitors during a 4-day novel phase compared to subsequent days in the exhibit. Because of constraints in exhibit design, however, increased use of exhibit did not always result in greater visibility of gorillas to zoo visitors. Gorillas increased locomotion, social distance, use of grass areas, and visibility to the public in their "Away" exhibit compared to their "Home" exhibit. Regularly alternating gorillas between zoo exhibits is a form of environmental enrichment that can increase gorillas' use of exhibit space and increase activity level. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {Nature-based tourism activities have been developing over the last decade, but it is still difficult to manage these activities sustainably. This sector is increasingly focusing on whales and dolphins in coastal communities, but the exact effects of these tourism activities are unclear. Markov chain modeling may help researchers assess the effects of tourism activities on the behavioral budget of small cetaceans. Matrix models have been used widely in population ecology to provide successful management guidelines. From June 2000 to August 2001, I collected information on the behavioral state of bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops spp.) schools from a population residing in Doubtful Sound, Fiordland, NewZealand. In addition, I recorded the occurrence of boat and dolphin interactions. I then calculated the transition probabilities of passing from one behavior to another by using a first-order, time-discrete Markov chain model. Behavioral transitions during which a boat- dolphin interaction occurredwere compiled in an “impact” chain. All other transitionswere tallied in a control chain. I then quantified the effect of boat-dolphin interactions during behavioral transitions by comparing the behavioral transition probabilities of both chains. Socializing and resting behaviors were disrupted by interactions with boats to a level that raises concern. Both the duration of bouts and the total amount of time spent in both these behavioral states were substantially decreased. Dolphins were significantly more likely to be traveling after an interaction with a boat. However, the overall behavioral budget of the population was not significantly affected. Therefore, the bottlenose dolphin population seems to be able to sustain the present level of boat interactions because of its low intensity. More effort is needed to develop prognosis analyses in order to understand how the effect of boat interactions on dolphins changes with variations in intensity. Efectos},

Dinotheriensande) and of 25 mammals of various systematic positions. Together with other finds from Eppelsheim and the Wissberg location, which is only 18 km away, these are the northernmost occurrences of Miocene primates in Europe. Both teeth, the crowns of an upper left canine and an upper right first molar, are exceptionally well preserved and obviously come from the same body of unknown sex. Their sedimentological environment and the accompanying faunal elements point to an age shortly before the Mid-Vallesian crisis at ca. 9.7 Ma. While the molar shares characters with various other taxa, the canine reveals intriguingly potential hominin affinities: its lingual outline is clearly diamond-shaped; its ratio of lingual height / mesiodistal length is within the range of Australopithecus afarensis, Ardipithecus ramidus, Ardipithecus kadabba, and females of Pan troglodytes. The relative size of the canine, i. e. the ratio of the buccal heights of C and M1, is similar to those of e.g. Dryopithecus sp., Ankarapithecus meteai but also Ardipithecus ramidus. Both, reduced size and shape of the canine likely indicate that the new species from Eppelsheim had lost a honing (C/p3) complex already ca. 9.7 Ma ago. From all information gathered up to now, the question arises, if the newly discovered Eppelsheim species may be related to members of the African hominin tribe.},

  abstract = {Sickle cell anaemia is a major chapter within haemolytic anaemias; at the same time, its epidemiology is a remarkable signature of the past and present world distribution of Plasmodium falciparum malaria. In this brief review, in keeping with the theme of this journal, we focus on the close and complex relationship betweeen this blood disease and this infectious disease. On one hand, heterozygotes for the sickle gene (AS) are relatively protected against the danger of dying of malaria, as now firmly established through a number of clinical field studies from different parts of Africa. In addition, experimental work is consistent with a plausibile mechanism: namely, that in AS heterozygotes P falciparum-infected red cells sickle preferentially and are then removed by macrophages. On the other hand, patients who are homozygous for the sickle gene and therefore suffer from sickle cell anaemia (SCA) are highly susceptible to the lethal effects of malaria. The simplest explanation of this fact is that malaria makes the anaemia of SCA more severe; in addition, in SCA there is often hyposplenism, which reduces clearance of parasites. From the point of view of public health it is important that in malaria-endemic countries patients with SCA, and particularly children, be protected from malaria by appropriate prophylaxis.},

The behavior of nine felid species housed in 11 enclosures was recorded using instantaneous scan sampling. Stereotypic pacing was observed in 15 out of 19 individuals. Size of enclosure did not affect pacing behavior, but edges of enclosures were found to be used specifically for pacing behavior. Cats in relatively larger enclosures had a higher level of apparent movement, but only about 50\% of enclosure space was used. Raised areas such as tree branches were found to be preferred sites in enclosures, particularly for observation of surroundings. The feeding regime was found to affect stereotypic pacing levels. Cats fed on a 3 day cycle paced more on fast days than on days they were fed. Although not statistically significant, 6 out of 7 of these cats paced more in the hour after feeding, whereas the cats fed daily paced more in the hour before feeding. Further research is required to understand the relationship between feeding and stereotypic behavior. Zoo Biol 16:71–83, 1997. © 1997 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

All behavioural sequences exhibited long-range autocorrelation, and linear mixed-effects models suggest that increasing infection with the nodular worm Oesophagostomum aculeatum, clinically impaired health, reproductive activity, ageing and low dominance status were associated with reductions in the complexity of locomotion, and to a lesser extent foraging, behaviour. Furthermore, the sequential complexity of behaviour increased with environmental complexity. We argue that a reduction in complexity in animal behaviour characterizes individuals in impaired or 'stressed' states, and may have consequences if animals cannot cope with heterogeneity in their natural habitats.},

  abstract = {Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)—a chronic, debilitating condition, broadly characterized by emotion dysregulation—is prevalent among US military personnel who have returned from Operations Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Iraqi Freedom (OIF). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a first-line treatment for PTSD, but treatment mechanisms are unknown and patient response varies. SSRIs may exert their effects by remediating emotion regulatory brain activity and individual differences in patient response might be explained, in part, by pre-treatment differences in neural systems supporting the downregulation of negative affect. Thirty-four OEF/OIF veterans, 17 with PTSD and 17 without PTSD underwent 2 functional magnetic resonance imaging scans 12 weeks apart. At each scan, they performed an emotion regulation task; in the interim, veterans with PTSD were treated with the SSRI, paroxetine. SSRI treatment increased activation in both the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) and supplementary motor area (SMA) during emotion regulation, although only change in the SMA over time occurred in veterans with PTSD and not those without PTSD. Less activation of the right ventrolateral PFC/inferior frontal gyrus during pre-treatment emotion regulation was associated with greater reduction in PTSD symptoms with SSRI treatment, irrespective of pre-treatment severity. Patients with the least recruitment of prefrontal emotion regulatory brain regions may benefit most from treatment with SSRIs, which appear to augment activity in these regions.},

  abstract = {Abstract Activity budgets of 18 captive snow leopards were analyzed in order to assess the behaviour of cats housed singly versus those housed socially. Six solitary snow leopards and 12 socially housed snow leopards were compared. Pacing and activity level were used as indicators of the potential welfare states of cats under these two conditions. Solitary snow leopards were observed to pace more and be more active than the cats from the social housing situation however results were not statistically significant. An enrichment study was conducted on eight of the 18 snow leopards involved. Feliway ® , a synthetic analogue of the F3 fraction of feline facial pheromone was used as a means of olfactory enrichment as well as simulated social contact. Pacing, activity level, and percentage of time allocated to scent related behaviours were recorded before, during, and after the enrichment. Although the results did not produce any statistically significant findings all of the eight cats followed a similar behavioural trend throughout the course of the treatment, which resulted in an observed increase in pacing, activity level and scent related behaviours during the treatment days with Feliway ® .}

  abstract = {Maternal abuse of offspring in macaque monkeys shares some similarities with child maltreatment in humans, including its transmission across generations. This study used a longitudinal design and a cross-fostering experiment to investigate whether abusive parenting in rhesus macaques is transmitted from mothers to daughters and whether transmission occurs through genetic or experiential factors. Nine of 16 females who were abused by their mothers in their first month of life, regardless of whether they were reared by their biological mothers or by foster mothers, exhibited abusive parenting with their firstborn offspring, whereas none of the females reared by nonabusive mothers did. These results suggest that the intergenerational transmission of infant abuse in rhesus monkeys is the result of early experience and not genetic inheritance. The extent to which the effects of early experience on the intergenerational transmission of abusive parenting are mediated by social learning or experience-induced physiological alterations remains to be established.},

  abstract = {Home ranges of three radio-collared Bengal tigers [one adult female (AF), one adult male (AM) and one sub-adult male (SAM)] were studied between March 2008 and December 2011 in Pench Tiger Reserve (PTR), Madhya Pradesh. Using 100\% Minimum Convex Polygon (MCP), the estimated home ranges of AF (n= 750 locations), AM (n= 136 locations) and SAM (n= 739 locations) were 43 km 2, 55.1 km 2 and 52.2 km 2 respectively. Using 95\% Fixed Kernel (FK), the corresponding figures were 32.1 km 2, 64.1 km 2 and 19.1 km 2. The core area of individual activity for each tiger, as determined by 65\% FK, was 10.3 km 2 for AF, 20.3 km 2 for AM and 6.6 km 2 for SAM. The estimated overlap area between AM and AF using 95\% FK was 19.2 km 2 (65\%), whereas it was 15.4 km 2 (48\%) between AF and SAM. The AF recruited three, four and five cubs in her 1 st (May 2008 and all died during post natal stage), 2 nd (October 2008) and 3 rd litter (October 2010) respectively. Minimum 44\% of the original natal area was used by AF at the time of raising her 2 nd litter and 46\% in her 3 rd litter. Though there was a gradual extension of the annual home range, as observed during the first two years (2008-2010), but the core activity area remained considerably the same for AF over the study period. The study revealed that a minimum of 25 to 30 km 2 undisturbed area was required for a breeding female in PTR where both the wild prey density (348.2/km 2) and biomass (12384.7 kg/ km 2) were found to be high with adequate ground cover for the successful raising of cubs up to the dispersal stage. Pench and its surrounding forested habitat need to be protected for the breeding and dispersing tiger population. © 2012 A. Majumder, S. Basu, K. Sankar, Q. Qureshi, Y.V. Jhala, P. Nigam, R. Gopal.},

Given the current rate of habitat fragmentation and its effect on animal populations, species conservation over the long term increasingly will require management to reduce risk of extinction. This may include ex situ populations which can support and interact demographically and genetically with wild populations. This paper presents a review of what can be achieved through a multidisciplinary approach, involving science, interactive management, politics, environmental education, habitat preservation and habitat restoration. Examples of what conservation-oriented breeding programmes have contributed to date, what represents a viable population and what is meant by effective conservation are provided, and various scenarios for the future are discussed.},

It is an important test to see to what extent two independent analysts will come up with the same analysis of a set of data. Sometimes the data speaks so clearly that anyone sensible would arrive at the same analysis. Often, that is not the case. It also presents an opportunity to review some exploratory data analysis techniques, as we start with a new data set.

These parameters were investigated by sex, age, and type of visitor grouping. The most looked-at exhibits were determined. For 573 visitors, the mean time in the reptile house was 14.7 minutes. Only about 8 minutes was spent looking at exhibits, and this time was strikingly similar for age, sex, and group type. Time spent looking at exhibits was negatively correlated with visitor density. Amphibians and lizards were looked at for less time than snakes and turtles. Crocodilians were looked at longer than the other taxonomic groups, while larger animals in all groups were looked at longer than smaller ones. This study and other similar studies imply that the public does not respond to exhibits with the expected interest and enthusiasm. It is hoped that with a better understanding of the public through research, zoo staff can improve visitor interest in the exhibits.},

Studies in controlled conditions have suggested that increased tail movement is an indicator of positive emotions in pigs, while others have proposed that increased ear movements are linked to negative emotions. This study aimed to investigate these indicators in pig farm conditions to analyze their validity and the effect of enrichment on welfare. Thirty-six pigs received one of the following enrichment materials: straw in a rack, wooden logs, or chains. Behavioral observations were performed by focal sampling. The results showed that tail movement duration was significantly higher when pigs exhibited \&ldquo;high use\&rdquo; (three or more pigs in a pen interacting with the enrichment) than when they exhibited \&ldquo;low use\&rdquo; (fewer than three) of enrichment (p = 0.04). A positive correlation was found between tail movement frequency and duration (r = 0.88; p = 0.02). The increase in tail movement could be considered an indicator of positive emotions in pigs when measured with other categories of indicators. Regarding ear movements, no significant difference was found. Future studies should further investigate these indicators thoroughly, as the results could be useful for improving the assessment of emotions in pigs.},

Eight to 10 litters of 8-, 2-, and 3-d-old piglets were assigned to each procedure. Within each litter, 2 piglets were assigned to 1 of 4 possible procedures: the 2 alternative methods, a sham procedure, and a sham procedure plus blood sampling. Blood was sampled before processing and at 45 min, 4 h, 48 h, 1 wk, and 2 wk postprocedure and assayed for cortisol and beta-endorphin. Procedures were videotaped and analyzed to evaluate the time taken to perform the procedure and the number of squeals, grunts, and escape attempts. Vocalizations were analyzed to determine mean and peak frequencies and duration. Piglets were weighed before the procedure and at 24 h, 48 h, 1 wk, and 2 wk afterward. Lesions were scored on a scale of 0 to 5 on pigs in the identification, tail docking, and castration treatments at 24 h, 1 wk, and 2 wk postprocedure. For teeth resection, grinding took longer than clipping and resulted in greater cortisol concentration overall, poorer growth rates, and longer vocalizations compared with pigs in the control treatment (P{$<$}0.05). For tail docking, hot clipping took longer, and hot-clipped piglets grew slower than cold-clipped piglets (P{$<$}0.05). Hot clipping also resulted in longer and higher frequency squealing compared with pigs in the control treatment (P{$<$}0.01). For identification, ear notching took longer than tagging, and ear-notched piglets had worse wound scores than tagged piglets (P{$<$}0.05). Cortisol concentrations at 4 h also tended to be greater for ear-notched piglets (P{$<$}0.10). Ear notching evoked calls with higher peak frequencies than the control treatments. For iron administration, oral delivery took numerically longer than injecting, but there were no significant differences between injecting and oral delivery for any of the measures. For castration, tearing took longer than cutting the cords (P{$<$}0.05), but beta-endorphin concentrations at 45 min postprocedure were greater for cut piglets. When measures of behavior, physiology, and productivity were used, the responses to teeth resection, tail docking, and identification were shown to be altered by the procedural method, whereas responses to iron administration and castration did not differ. The time taken to carry out the procedure would appear to be an important factor in the strength of the stress response.},

After receiving a thorough professional prophylaxis at the baseline, over the next 3-days each volunteer refrained from all oral hygiene measures and had two daily rinses with 20 ml of the test mouthwash (alcohol free essential oil) or the control mouthwash (essential oil with alcohol). At the end of the each experimental period, plaque was assessed and the panelists filled out a questionnaire. Each subject underwent a 14 days washout period and there was a second allocation.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: The essential oil mouthwash with ethanol shows a better inhibitory effect of plaque regrowth in 3-days than the mouthwash test with only essential oil in the whole mouth (plaque index = 2.18 against 2.46, respectively, p {$<$} 0.05); for the lower jaw (plaque index = 2.28 against 2.57, respectively, p {$<$} 0.05); for the upper jaw (plaque index = 2.08 against 2.35, respectively, p {$<$} 0.05); for the incisors (plaque index = 1.93 against 2.27, respectively, p {$<$} 0.05); and the canines (plaque index = 1.99 against 2.47, respectively, p {$<$} 0.05).\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSION: The essential oil containing mouthwash without alcohol seems to have a less inhibiting effect on the plaque regrowth than the traditional alcoholic solution.},

  abstract = {A complexity analysis was performed on the behaviour time series of four groups of seven chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) using the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA). DFA quantifies the fractal-like correlation properties of behaviour sequences on short time scales (seconds) over active periods of approximately 0.5h (2050s). In this study the level of randomization of locomotor and resting sequences was related to the rearing conditions of chickens. The complexity of locomotor sequences decreased with high stress (food limitation). Adding a sand substrate increased the complexity of other activities such as perching, foraging, and resting but reduced the complexity of locomotor behaviour due to the display of sand bath behaviour. In addition, the correspondence between the complexity of behaviour sequences and age was more pronounced under control situations than under stress (food limited). Under stress it appeared that there was not enough energy to perform complex adult behaviour. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Magnetoreception, the ability to sense the Earth’s magnetic field (MF), is a widespread phenomenon in the animal kingdom. In 1966, the first report on a magnetosensitive vertebrate, the European robin ( Erithacus rubecula ), was published. After that, numerous further species of different taxa have been identified to be magnetosensitive as well. Recently, it has been demonstrated that domestic dogs ( Canis lupus familiaris ) prefer to align their body axis along the North–South axis during territorial marking under calm MF conditions and that they abandon this preference when the Earth’s MF is unstable. In a further study conducting a directional two-choice-test, dogs showed a spontaneous preference for the northern direction. Being designated as putatively magnetosensitive and being also known as trainable for diverse choice and search tests, dogs seem to be suitable model animals for a direct test of magnetoreception: learning to find a magnet. Using operant conditioning dogs were trained to identify the MF of a bar magnet in a three-alternative forced-choice experiment. We excluded visual cues and used control trials with food treats to test for the role of olfaction in finding the magnet. While 13 out of 16 dogs detected the magnet significantly above chance level (53–73\% success rate), none of the dogs managed to do so in finding the food treat (23–40\% success rate). In a replication of the experiment under strictly blinded conditions five out of six dogs detected the magnet above chance level (53–63\% success rate). These experiments support the existence of a magnetic sense in domestic dogs. Whether the sense enables dogs to perceive MFs as weak as the Earth’s MF, if they use it for orientation, and by which mechanism the fields are perceived remain open questions.},

We investigate how the structure and tooling of software packages of the R programming language are being used to produce research compendia in a variety of disciplines. We also describe how software engineering tools and services are being used by researchers to streamline working with research compendia. Using real-world examples, we show how researchers can improve the reproducibility of their work using research compendia based on R packages and related tools.},

  abstract = {We estimate that stereotypies are currently displayed by over 85 million farm, laboratory and zoo animals worldwide. This paper investigates their reliability as welfare indicators, by surveying studies relating stereotypy to other welfare measures and by analysing the mechanisms underlying this behaviour. Where data exist, most (approximately 68\%) situations that cause/increase stereotypies also decrease welfare. Stereotypy-eliciting situations are thus likely to be poor for welfare, although exceptions exist. Within such an environment however, most (approximately 60\%) accounts link individual stereotypy performance with improved welfare (cf approximately 20\% linking it with reduced welfare). Thus, in a sub-optimal environment non-stereotyping or low-stereotyping individuals could well have the poorest welfare, although again exceptions exist. Examining the mechanisms underlying stereotypy performance, we discuss four processes that could account for these complex links between stereotypy and welfare. Beneficial consequences from performing the specific source-behaviour of the stereotypy (do-it-yourself enrichment), or arising from repetition per se ('mantra effects'), may ameliorate welfare in poor environments. In addition, stereotypies that have become centrally controlled (habit-like), or that arise from autistic-like changes in the control of all behaviour (perseveration), are likely to be unreliable indicators of current state because they can be elicited by, or persist in, circumstances that improve welfare. To refine the role of stereotypy in welfare assessment we suggest the collection of specific additional data to reveal when any of these four processes is acting. Until such research increases our understanding, stereotypies should always be taken seriously as a warning sign of potential suffering, but never used as the sole index of welfare, non-stereotyping or low-stereotyping individuals should not be overlooked or assumed to be faring well, simple measures of frequency should not be used to compare stereotypies that differ in age, form, or the biological or experiential characteristics of the performing animal, enrichments that do not immediately reduce stereotypies should not be assumed failures with respect to welfare, and finally, stereotypies should not be reduced by means other than tackling their underlying motivations.},

Captive animals are often healthier, longer-lived and more fecund than free-living conspecifics, but for some species the opposite is true. Captivity is a very long way from the ideal 'common garden' often assumed by evolutionary and ecological researchers using data for captive animals. The use of comparative methods to investigate the fundamental biological causes of these species differences would help to improve husbandry and enclosure design, and might even reveal relationships between susceptibilities to poor captive welfare and susceptibilities to anthropogenic threat in the wild. Studies of these species differences could also inspire and facilitate 'evo-mecho' research into the functions of behavioral control mechanisms.},

Concern over the welfare of confined animals is continuing to increase and extends not only to farm and zoo animals, but also to laboratory and companion animals. This book focuses on environmentally-induced stereotypes, rather than drug-induced or neurologically-based stereotypes and discusses why captive animals perform these stereotypes. It also examines what this behavior can tell us about animal welfare, options for prevention and cure and assesses future research directions and implications for animal welfare.},

  abstract = {In Germany, an animal welfare ordinance for the housing of rabbits was issued which did not take into account the current investigations on floor design. The aim of the investigations was to study the effects of floor design on dirtiness and occurrence of lesions on the legs of growing rabbits. A total of 1837 weaned rabbits, kept on four different floor designs, were examined for body lesions and the dirtiness of the soles of the feet at the end of the growing period. Two four-stage scoring systems (0\&ndash;3) were used to record the dirtiness and the lesions on the feet. A floor according to the provisions of the German animal protection ordinance (10 mm slat width; 50\% perforation on floor area; \&lt;15\% perforation on the elevated platform) led to the most polluted and injured rabbits. The best cleanliness and the lowest injury rate of the growing rabbits was achieved on a plastic floor with 5 mm slat width and 13 mm slot width, both on the ground and elevated platform (75\% perforation). The requirements of the German housing regulations on the floor for growing rabbits do not correspond to animal welfare.},

To date, however, quantitative studies on intragroup affiliative behaviours in social carnivores have been limited. Here, we investigated the social functions of the two most commonly observed affiliative behaviours in captive African lions (Panthera leo): head rubbing and licking. We conducted behavioural observations on a captive group of lions composed of 7 males and 14 females, and tested hypotheses regarding three social functions: tension reduction, social bonding, and social status expression. Disproportionately frequent male-male and female-to-male head rubbing was observed, while more than 95\% of all licking interactions occurred in female-female dyads. In accordance with the social bond hypothesis, and in disagreement with the social status expression hypothesis, both head rubbing and licking interactions were reciprocal. After controlling for spatial association, the dyadic frequency of head rubbing was negatively correlated with age difference while licking was positively correlated with relatedness. Group reunion after daily separation did not affect the frequencies of the affiliative behaviours, which was in disagreement with the predictions from the tension reduction hypothesis. These results support the social bond hypothesis for the functions of head rubbing and licking. Different patterns of affiliative behaviour between the sexes may reflect differences in the relationship quality in each sex or the differential predisposition to licking due to its original function in offspring care.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND The prevalence of dementia is of interest worldwide. Contemporary estimates are needed to plan for future care provision, but much evidence is decades old. We aimed to investigate whether the prevalence of dementia had changed in the past two decades by repeating the same approach and diagnostic methods as used in the Medical Research Council Cognitive Function and Ageing Study (MRC CFAS) in three of the original study areas in England. METHODS BETWEEN 1989 and 1994, MRC CFAS investigators did baseline interviews in populations aged 65 years and older in six geographically defined areas in England and Wales. A two stage process, with screening followed by diagnostic assessment, was used to obtain data for algorithmic diagnoses (geriatric mental state–automated geriatric examination for computer assisted taxonomy), which were then used to estimate dementia prevalence. Data from three of these areas—Cambridgeshire, Newcastle, and Nottingham—were selected for CFAS I. Between 2008 and 2011, new fieldwork was done in the same three areas for the CFAS II study. For both CFAS I and II, each area needed to include 2500 individuals aged 65 years and older to provide power for geographical and generational comparison. Sampling was stratified according to age group (65–74 years vs ≥75 years). CFAS II used identical sampling, approach, and diagnostic methods to CFAS I, except that screening and assessement were combined into one stage. Prevalence estimates were calculated using inverse probability weighting methods to adjust for sampling design and non-response. Full likelihood Bayesian models were used to investigate informative non-response. FINDINGS 7635 people aged 65 years or older were interviewed in CFAS I (9602 approached, 80\% response) in Cambridgeshire, Newcastle, and Nottingham, with 1457 being diagnostically assessed. In the same geographical areas, the CFAS II investigators interviewed 7796 individuals (14 242 approached, 242 with limited frailty information, 56\% response). Using CFAS I age and sex specific estimates of prevalence in individuals aged 65 years or older, standardised to the 2011 population, 8·3\% (884 000) of this population would be expected to have dementia in 2011. However, CFAS II shows that the prevalence is lower (6·5\%; 670 000), a decrease of 1·8\% (odds ratio for CFAS II vs CFAS I 0·7, 95\% CI 0·6–0·9, p=0·003). Sensitivity analyses suggest that these estimates are robust to the change in response. INTERPRETATION This study provides further evidence that a cohort effect exists in dementia prevalence. Later-born populations have a lower risk of prevalent dementia than those born earlier in the past century. FUNDING UK Medical Research Council.},

John Maynard Smith's concept of an evolutionarily stable strategy is relevant whenever the best thing for an animal or plant to do depends on what others are doing. The theory leads to testable predictions about the evolution of behaviour, of sex and genetic systems, and of growth and life history patterns. This book contains the first full account of the theory, and of the data relevant to it. The account is aimed at senior undergraduate and graduate students, teachers and research workers in animal behaviour, population genetics and evolutionary biology. The book will also be of interest to mathematicians and game theorists; the mathematics has been largely confined to appendixes so that the main text may be easily followed by biologists.},

  abstract = {Despite evidence from several bird, fish and mammal species that listeners can discriminate between the vocalizations of familiar and unfamiliar adult conspecifics, direct links between discriminatory abilities and fitness benefits have been difficult to identify. In free-ranging populations of African lions (Panthera leo), females with cubs face a substantial threat from one particular category of unfamiliar individuals: infanticidal males. Here we use playback experiments to demonstrate that females with cubs can distinguish immediately between roars from their own resident males (the fathers of the cubs) and those from unfamiliar, potentially infanticidal males. Although they remain relaxed when played roars from resident males, they immediately become agitated on hearing unfamiliar males and retreat rapidly with their cubs if the latter have reached about 4.5 months of age. These responses are not simply a function of the roarers being unfamiliar, for when played the roars of unfamiliar females, females with cubs consistently approach the loudspeaker. Furthermore, females often move toward the cubs in response to playbacks of unfamiliar males but not in response to playbacks of unfamiliar females or resident males. Our results suggest how females with cubs might, by quickly detecting and categorizing unfamiliar intruders within their territory, protect their cubs from infanticidal males and expel intruding females. Distinguishing between individuals on the basis of their vocal characteristics could therefore confer direct fitness benefits on discriminating lionesses.},

  abstract = {Theoretical and experimental studies of assessment in animal contests have, until now, focused on disputes between single individuals. However, whereas single competitors usually avoid fights with opponents that are larger or stronger than themselves, in contests between social groups competitors might be expected to adjust their agonistic behaviour according to the number of individuals in their own and the opposing group. This hypothesis was tested using playback experiments to generate controlled artificial contests between groups of female lions. Recordings of single females roaring and groups of three females roaring in chorus were played back to simulate the presence of unfamiliar intruders within the territories of 21 different lion prides in Serengeti National Park, Tanzania. Defending adult females were less likely to approach playbacks of three intruders than of a single intruder and on occasions when they did approach three intruders they made their approach more cautiously. Defenders also carefully adjusted their decision to approach according to the size and composition of their own group, and attempted to recruit extra companions to the contest by roaring when some were absent at the time of playback. A strong selective advantage to avoiding the costs of fighting with larger groups could have led to the widespread evolution of numerical assessment skills in social species.},

  abstract = {An account of the development of temporal understanding is proposed which links such understanding with the development of episodic memory. We distinguish between different ways of representing time in terms of the kinds of temporal frameworks they involve. Distinctions are made between frameworks that are perspectival or nonperspectival and those that represent recurrent sequences or particular times. Even primitive temporal understanding integrates both perspectival and nonperspectival components. However, since early frameworks are event-based and localized, they are not yet sufficient for episodic memory in that they do not enable the child to think of events as having occurred at particular points in time. We describe the emergence of new kinds of frameworks in terms of the development of temporal decentering. Two levels of temporal decentering are distinguished, with the higher level involving an appreciation of how event representations depend on one's temporal perspective. (C) 1999 Academic Press.},

It is argued that this definition applies to the personality traits of the five-factor model. Evidence for the endogenous nature of traits is summarized from studies of behavior genetics, parent-child relations, personality structure, animal personality, and the longitudinal stability of individual differences. New evidence for intrinsic maturation is offered from analyses of NEO Five-Factor Inventory scores for men and women age 14 and over in German, British, Spanish, Czech, and Turkish samples (N = 5,085). These data support strong conceptual links to child temperament despite modest empirical associations. The intrinsic maturation of personality is complemented by the culturally conditioned development of characteristic adaptations that express personality; interventions in human development are best addressed to these.},

  abstract = {American Crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos) have become common suburban and urban birds in the last 50 years, using these environments for roosting and breeding. I studied crows in upstate New York from 1989 to 1999, and compared reproductive success, survival, and social behavior of crows in suburban and rural areas. Although both suburban and rural crows maintained permanent territories, suburban American Crows had smaller territories and nested at higher densities. Both suburban and rural crows periodically left their territories in fall and winter to join foraging aggregations and to roost at night. The proportion of nests attended by auxiliaries did not differ, but suburban nests were attended by larger families. Overall nest success was higher in suburban areas. Success rates during the egg stage of the nest cycle did not differ between habitat, but suburban nests had higher success during the nestling stage of the nest cycle. Survival of crows post fledging was better in suburban areas, but after one year annual survival rates did not differ between the habitats. Birds raised in one habitat tended to breed in the same habitat. Although clutch sizes and egg hatchability did not differ between the habitats, rural nests produced nearly one more young per successful nest and significantly larger young than suburban crows, suggesting that food resources were better in rural areas. Data from a drought year, a time of apparent food shortage, suggested that suburban food resources also were less dependable than those in rural areas. The increase in American Crows over the last 25 years in eastern North America may be due in part to the successful exploitation of suburban nesting habitats.},

  abstract = {The last decade has seen a resurgence of interest in laterality of function in primates, especially in hand use as it links to handedness and language in Homo sapiens. Manual lateralization of behavior in humans reflects asymmetry in cerebral structure, which must have evolved from nonhuman progenitors. To what extent is hand function lateralized in our nearest living relations? First, we address current issues of theory and methodology: statistics, measurement, variables, setting, sensory modality, and sample size. Specific topics include preference vs. performance, posture, bimanuality, inheritance, and arm asymmetry. We categorize the published literature in a descriptive, classificatory framework of five levels that range from Level 1, ambilaterality, to Level 5, human-like handedness. In a meta-analysis we put 241 published data-sets to a methodological test of seven criteria and code the 48 survivors onto the levels framework, by taxonomic grouping (prosimian, NewWorld monkey, OldWorld monkey, ape, chimpanzee). Primates at Level 1 are mostly wild or naturalistic populations performing spontaneous species-typical behavior patterns. Most primates are at Levels 2 and 3, that is, individually lateralized to either side, especially on complex, demanding or practiced tasks, usually as devised in captive settings. Only chimpanzees show signs of population-level bias (Levels 4 and 5) to the right, but only in captivity and only incompletely. We conclude that nonhu- manprimate hand function has not been shown to be lateralized at the species level—it is not the norm for any species, task, or setting, and so offers no easy model for the evolution of human handedness.

  abstract = {The millennia-old practices of horse training markedly predate and thus were isolated from the mid-twentieth century revelation of animal learning processes. From this standpoint, the progress made in the application and understanding of learning theory in horse training is reviewed including a discussion of how learning processes are employed or otherwise under-utilised in training. This review describes the process of habituation and the most commonly applied desensitisation techniques (systematic desensitisation, counter-conditioning, overshadowing, response prevention) and propose two additional techniques (approach conditioning and stimulus blending). The salience of different types of cues, the interaction of operant and classical conditioning and the impact of stress are also discussed. This paper also exposes the inflexibility and occasional inadequacy of the terminology of learning theory when translated from the research laboratory situation to the practical setting in horse training. While learning theory provides a rich toolbox for riders and trainers, the training process is subject to the simultaneous use of multiple learning processes. In addition, learning/behavioural outcomes and trained responses are not just the result of simple stimulus-response based interactions but are further shaped by arousal, affective and attachment states. More research is needed in these areas. For the field of equitation science to progress and to improve clarity and use of learning processes, changes in nomenclature are required. In particular, the use of the terms ‘positive’ and ‘negative’ as descriptive labels in both reinforcement and punishment modalities are unacceptably misleading for everyday use. These labels inhibit the understanding and recognition of the learning processes that these terms supposedly represent, yet the learning processes they describe are vital for horse riders, handlers and trainers to understand. We therefore propose that these labels should be re-labelled more appropriately as ‘addition’ or ‘subtraction’ reinforcement/punishment. This would enlighten trainers on the correct application of learning theory, and safety and welfare benefits for people and horses would follow. Finally it is also proposed that the term ‘conflict theory’ be taken up in equitation science to facilitate diagnosis of training-related behaviour disorders and thus enable the emergence of improved training practices. The optimal use of learning theory should be established as a fundamental principle in equestrian education.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rapamycin is a specific inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). We recently reported that administration of rapamycin before exposure to ascending aortic constriction significantly attenuated the load-induced increase in heart weight by approximately 70\%. METHODS AND RESULTS: To examine whether rapamycin can regress established cardiac hypertrophy, mice were subjected to pressure overload (ascending aortic constriction) for 1 week, echocardiography was performed to verify an increase in ventricular wall thickness, and mice were given rapamycin (2 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)) for 1 week. After 1 week of pressure overload (before treatment), 2 distinct groups of animals became apparent: (1) mice with compensated cardiac hypertrophy (normal function) and (2) mice with decompensated hypertrophy (dilated with depressed function). Rapamycin regressed the pressure overload-induced increase in heart weight/body weight (HW/BW) ratio by 68\% in mice with compensated hypertrophy and 41\% in mice with decompensated hypertrophy. Rapamycin improved left ventricular end-systolic dimensions, fractional shortening, and ejection fraction in mice with decompensated cardiac hypertrophy. Rapamycin also altered the expression of some fetal genes, reversing, in part, changes in alpha-myosin heavy chain and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase. CONCLUSIONS: Rapamycin may be a therapeutic tool to regress established cardiac hypertrophy and improve cardiac function.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Contraction of cardiac myocytes is initiated by Ca(2+) entry through the voltage-dependent L-type Ca(2+) channel (LTCC). Previous studies have shown that phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase signaling modulates LTCC function. Because PI 3-kinases are key mediators of insulin action, we investigated whether LTCC function is affected in diabetic animals due to reduced PI 3-kinase signaling. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used whole-cell patch clamping and biochemical assays to compare cardiac LTCC function and PI 3-kinase signaling in insulin-deficient diabetic mice heterozygous for the Ins2(Akita) mutation versus nondiabetic littermates. RESULTS: Diabetic mice had a cardiac contractility defect, reduced PI 3-kinase signaling in the heart, and decreased L-type Ca(2+) current (I(Ca,L)) density in myocytes compared with control nondiabetic littermates. The lower I(Ca,L) density in myocytes from diabetic mice is due at least in part to reduced cell surface expression of the LTCC. I(Ca,L) density in myocytes from diabetic mice was increased to control levels by insulin treatment or intracellular infusion of PI 3,4,5-trisphosphate PI(3,4,5)P(3). This stimulatory effect was blocked by taxol, suggesting that PI(3,4,5)P(3) stimulates microtubule-dependent trafficking of the LTCC to the cell surface. The voltage dependence of steady-state activation and inactivation of I(Ca,L) was also shifted to more positive potentials in myocytes from diabetic versus nondiabetic animals. PI(3,4,5)P(3) infusion eliminated only the difference in voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation of I(Ca,L). CONCLUSIONS: Decreased PI 3-kinase signaling in myocytes from type 1 diabetic mice leads to reduced Ca(2+) entry through the LTCC, which might contribute to the negative effect of diabetes on cardiac contractility.},

Most research on the social dynamics of wolf packs, however, has been conducted on non-natural assortments of captive wolves. Here I describe the wolf-pack social order as it occurs in nature, discuss the alpha concept and social dominance and submission, and present data on the precise relationships among members in free-living packs based on a literature review and 13 summers of observations of wolves on Ellesmere Island, Northwest Territories, Canada. I conclude that the typical wolf pack is a family, with the adult parents guiding the activities of the group in a division-of-labor system in which the female predominates primarily in such activities as pup care and defense and the male primarily during foraging and food-provisioning and the travels associated with them.

  abstract = {Cognitive mechanisms are an important part of the organization of the behavior systems of animals. In the wild, animals regularly face problems that they must overcome in order to survive and thrive. Solving such problems often requires animals to process, store, retrieve, and act upon information from the environment-in other words, to use their cognitive skills. For example, animals may have to use navigational, tool-making or cooperative social skills in order to procure their food. However, many enrichment programs for captive animals do not include the integration of these types of cognitive challenges. Thus, foraging enrichments typically are designed to facilitate the physical expression of feeding behaviors such as food-searching and food consumption, but not to facilitate complex problem solving behaviors related to food acquisition. Challenging animals by presenting them with problems is almost certainly a source of frustration and stress. However, we suggest here that this is an important, and even necessary, feature of an enrichment program, as long as animals also possess the skills and resources to effectively solve the problems with which they are presented. We discuss this with reference to theories about the emotional consequences of coping with challenge, the association between lack of challenge and the development of abnormal behavior, and the benefits of stress (arousal) in facilitating learning and memory of relevant skills. Much remains to be done to provide empirical support for these theories. However, they do point the way to a practical approach to improving animal welfare-to design enrichments to facilitate the cognitive mechanisms which underlie the performance of complex behaviors that cannot be performed due to the restrictions inherent to the captive environment. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Their evolutionary history is important both for understanding the evolution of sociality and that of other sympatric species owing to their widespread distribution throughout the entire Holarctic region during the Pleistocene. Lion grouping patterns, cooperative behaviour and strategies vary throughout their range and in different habitats. Their resilience in diverse habitats facing a variety of conservation pressures is largely owing to this plasticity of lion social behaviour. This review describes the variation in social organisation of lions in 11 habitats across Africa, taking into account relevant ecological parameters. The social organization of the Asiatic Lion is described from this perspective using the results of previous studies and of a five-year study conducted between 2002 and 2006 in the Gir forest of India.},

  abstract = {The resurrection of Asiatic lions (Panthera leo persica) from the brink of extinction is a remarkable conservation success story. Yet, occurrence of lions as a single population makes them vulnerable to extinction from genetic and environmental factors. Asiatic lions exist as a single free ranging population of 360 individuals in Gir Protected Area (PA; about 290 lions) and surrounding satellite areas (68 lions), namely Girnar Wildlife Sanctuary (WLS), coastal areas, hill ranges extending from Mitiyala-Savarkundla-Palitana-Shihor spreading across Junagadh, Amreli and Bhavnagar districts of Gujarat State, India. This paper traces the conservation history, current conservation pressures, and critically evaluates current conservation planning based on lion ecology and existing anthropogenic pressures. Conservation proposals for translocation of lions to alternate habitats in Kuno WLS and Barda WLS are awaiting final implementation. An alternate initiative is aimed at developing satellite lion habitats, improving corridor connectivity, and facilitating natural dispersal and expansion of lion habitats. The paper evaluates human population living within 2 km boundary of lion habitats and between Gir PA and satellite habitats to show that dispersing lions have to cross heavily populated habitations taking refuge in agriculture fields and scattered forest patches. Satellite habitats vary in size from 18 km2 (Mitiyala WLS) to 250 km2 (scattered forests Hipavadli-Savarkundla-Palitana zone along Shetrunji river) and are inadequate to maintain natural ranging and movement requirements of territorial lions. These habitats are varied in vegetation, terrain, human pressure, and distance to source population. Though satellite lion habitats are important suboptimal habitats for dispersing lions, long-term conservation planning require planned restoration of mosaic habitats for growing populations. © Springer-Verlag 2009.},

We confirmed a nonlinear relationship of head-body length against hind-foot length, tail length, and tibia length across the time course from neonate to adult and also discovered a nonlinear relationship between both skull and femur length to head-body length. Differences, in growth rate are directly related to preweaning and postweaning periods. The pattern of differential growth was distinctly least pronounced for femoral length. We therefore advocate the latter as the most appropriate to use as an easily measured proxy for growth across the entire neonate to adult growth period. This study reveals implications for the choice of optimal variables used as size proxies and also suggests functional implications of shifts in form-function relationships from unweaned to weaned individuals. However, variation in body form across mammals and altricial versus precocial modes of natal expression will continue to complicate the search for appropriate comparative metrics in the Study of the development and evolution of body form.},

  abstract = {The Five Freedoms have had major impact on animal welfare thinking internationally. However, despite clear initial statements that the words ‘freedom from’ should indicate ‘as free as possible from’, the Freedoms have come to be represented as absolute or fundamental freedoms, even rights, by some animal advocate and other groups. Moreover, a marked increase in scientific understanding over the last two decades shows that the Freedoms do not capture the more nuanced knowledge of the biological processes that is germane to understanding animal welfare and which is now available to guide its management. For example, the named negative experiences of thirst, hunger, discomfort and pain, and others identified subsequently, including breathlessness, nausea, dizziness, debility, weakness and sickness, can never be eliminated, merely temporarily neutralised. Each one is a genetically embedded element that motivates animals to behave in particular ways to obtain specific life-sustaining resources, avoid or reduce physical harm or facilitate recovery from infection or injury. Their undoubted negativity creates a necessary sense of urgency to respond, without which animals would not survive. Also, the temporary neutralisation of these survival-critical affects does not in and of itself generate positive experience. This questions the commonly held assumption that good animal welfare will result when these internally generated negative affects are minimised. Animals may also experience other negative affects that include anxiety, fear, panic, frustration, anger, helplessness, loneliness, boredom and depression. These situation-related affects reflect animals’ perceptions of their external circumstances. Although they are elicited by threatening, cramped, barren and/or isolated conditions, they can often be replaced by positive affects when animals are kept with congenial others in spacious, stimulus-rich and safe environments which provide opportunities for them to engage in behaviours they find rewarding. These behaviours may include environment-focused exploration and food acquisition activities as well as animal-to-animal interactive activities, all of which can generate various forms of comfort, pleasure, interest, confidence and a sense of control. Animal welfare management should aim to reduce the intensity of survival-critical negative affects to tolerable levels that nevertheless still elicit the required behaviours, and should also provide opportunities for animals to behave in ways they find rewarding, noting that poor management of survival-critical affects reduces animals’ motivation to utilize such rewarding opportunities. This biologically more accurate understanding provides support for reviewing the adequacy of provisions in current codes of welfare or practice in order to ensure that animals are given greater opportunities to experience positive welfare states. The purpose is to help animals to have lives worth living, which is not possible when the predominant focus of such codes is on survival-critical measures. Finally, an updated characterisation of animal welfare that incorporates this more accurate understanding is presented.},

  abstract = {The focus of this opinion is on the key features of sentience in animals which can experience different states of welfare, encapsulated by the new term ‘welfare-aligned sentience’. This term is intended to exclude potential forms of sentience that do not enable animals in some taxa to have the subjective experiences which underlie different welfare states. As the scientific understanding of key features of sentience has increased markedly during the last 10 to 15 years, a major purpose here is to provide up-to-date information regarding those features. Eleven interconnected statements about sentience-associated body functions and behaviour are therefore presented and explained briefly. These statements are sequenced to provide progressively more information about key scientifically-supported attributes of welfare-aligned sentience, leading, in their entirety, to a more comprehensive understanding of those attributes. They are as follows: (1) Internal structure–function interactions and integration are the foundations of sentience; (2) animals posess a capacity to respond behaviourally to a range of sensory inputs; (3) the more sophisticated nervous systems can generate subjective experiences, that is, affects; (4) sentience means that animals perceive or experience different affects consciously; (5) within a species, the stage of neurobiological development is significant; (6) during development the onset of cortically-based consciousness is accompanied by cognitively-enhanced capacities to respond behaviourally to unpredictable postnatal environments; (7) sentience includes capacities to communicate with others and to interact with the environment; (8) sentience incorporates experiences of negative and positive affects; (9) negative and positive affective experiences ‘matter’ to animals for various reasons; (10) acknowledged obstacles inherent in anthropomorphism are largely circumvented by new scientific knowledge, but caution is still required; and (11) there is increasing evidence for sentience among a wider range of invertebrates. The science-based explanations of these statements provide the foundation for a brief definition of ‘welfare-aligned sentience’, which is offered for consideration. Finally, it is recommended that when assessing key features of sentience the same emphasis should be given to positive and negative affective experiences in the context of their roles in, or potential impacts on, animal welfare.},

  abstract = {Accurate assessment of animal emotion (affect) is an important goal in animal welfare science, and in areas such as neuroscience and psychopharmacology. Direct measures of conscious emotion are not available, so assessment of animal affect has relied on measures of the behavioural and physiological components of affective states. These are important indicators but have some limitations (e.g. measuring emotional arousal rather than valence (positivity vs negativity)). Human psychology research suggests that changes in cognitive function (information processing) can also be reliable indicators of emotional state (especially valence). For example, people in negative states attend to threats, retrieve negative memories, and make negative judgements about ambiguous stimuli more than happier people. Here we review a new research area investigating the possibility that such affect-induced 'cognitive biases' also occur in animals. We focus on a novel 'judgement bias' paradigm in which animals are trained that one cue predicts a positive event and another cue predicts a less positive/negative event, and are then presented with ambiguous (intermediate) cues. The hypothesis is that animals in a negative affective state will be more likely to respond to ('judge') these ambiguous cues as if they predict the negative event (a 'pessimistic' response), than animals in a more positive state. Recent studies of rats, dogs, rhesus monkeys, starlings and humans provide face-value support for this hypothesis. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the affect manipulation treatments used in these studies, and the possibility that treatment-induced changes in feeding motivation, general activity and learning are responsible for the effects observed, and we consider whether the type of bias observed and the precise design of the judgement bias task can provide information about different types of affective state. Judgement biases may result from the influence of affect on decision-making processes including attention to and perception of the ambiguous cue, evaluation of the value and probability (expected utility) of the outcomes of different responses, and action selection. Affect might also modulate general tendencies of loss, risk and ambiguity aversion, hence biasing decisions. We discuss these possibilities in relation to theory and findings from neurobiological and psychological studies of decision-making, in order to better understand the potential mechanisms underlying judgement biases.

  abstract = {Abstract: The remnant wild population of California Condors (Gymnogyps californianus) of the 1980s exhibited a rapid population decline caused by high mortality rates among adult and immature birds. The most prominent mortality factor was lead poisoning resulting from ingestion of bullet fragments in carcasses. Successful captive breeding has allowed many birds to be released to the wild since 1992, based originally on an assumption that exposure to lead could be prevented by food subsidy. The mortality of released birds, however, has generally exceeded levels needed for population stability calculated from simple population models. Collision with overhead wires was the most frequent cause of death in releases before 1994. Lead poisoning again surfaced as a problem starting in 1997 as older birds began feeding on carcasses outside the subsidy program. Although poisonings have been treated successfully by chelation therapy in recaptured birds, food subsidy is proving an ineffective solution to lead exposure. The best long-term solution appears to be either the creation of large reserves where hunting is prohibited or the restriction of hunting to nontoxic ammunition in release areas. Until sources of lead contamination are effectively countered, releases cannot be expected to result in viable populations. In addition, problems involving human-oriented behavior have resulted in the permanent removal of many released birds from the wild. The most promising reduction in human-oriented behavior has been achieved in one release of aversively conditioned, parent-reared birds. Rigorous evaluation of the factors reducing attraction to humans and human structures has been hampered by confounding of techniques in releases. Behavioral problems could be more quickly overcome by adoption of a comprehensive experimental approach. Resumen: Las poblaciones silvestres remanentes del cóndor de California (Gymnogyps californianus) de los anõs 80 exhibieron una disminución poblacional rápida debido a altas tasas de mortalidad de individuos adultos e inmaduros. El factor de mortalidad más prominente fue el envenenamiento por plomo ocasionado por la ingestión de fragmentos de municiones en cadáveres. La reproducción exitosa en cautiverio ha permitido muchas liberaciones en ambientes silvestres desde 1992, bajo el argumento de que la exposición al plomo puede ser prevenida mediante el subsidio de alimento. Sin embargo, la mortalidad de aves liberadas ha excedido generalmente los niveles necesarios para alcanzar una estabilidad poblacional calculada a partir de modelos poblacionales simples. Las colisiones con alambres en lo alto fueron la causa más frecuente de las muertes en liberaciones anteriores a 1994. A partir de 1997, el envenenamiento con plomo surgió una vez más como un problema, puesto que las aves de edad avanzada comenzaron a alimentarse de cadáveres fuera del programa de subsidio. A pesar de que el envenenamiento ha sido tratado exitosamente mediante terapia de quelación de las aves recapturadas, el subsidio de alimento ha probado ser una solución ineficaz contra la exposición al plomo. Las mejores soluciones de largo plazo aparentan ser la creación de reservas grandes donde la caza sea prohibida o se restrinja la caza a municiones no tóxicas en las áreas de liberación. Solo una vez que la contaminación por plomo sea contrarrestada efectivamente, no se podrá esperar que las liberaciones resulten en poblaciones viables. Además, los problemas de conductas orientadas hacia humanos ha resultado en la remoción permanente de muchas aves liberadas de zonas silvestres. La reducción más prometedora de conductas orientadas hacia humanos ha sido obtenida en una liberación de aves criadas por sus padres y condicionadas adversamente. La evaluación rigurosa de los factores que reducen la atracción hacia humanos y estructuras de humanos ha sido obstaculizada por la confusión de técnicas en las liberaciones. Los problemas de conducta podrían ser superados más rápidamente mediante la adopción de una estrategia experimental comprensiva.},

  abstract = {Physiological changes provide indices of stress responses, however, behavioural measures may be easier to determine. Spontaneous eye blink rate has potential as a non-invasive indicator of stress. Eyelid movements, along with heart rate (HR) and behaviour, from 33 horses were evaluated over four treatments: (1) control\&mdash;horse in its normal paddock environment; (2) feed restriction\&mdash;feed was withheld at regular feeding time; (3) separation\&mdash;horse was removed from visual contact with their paddock mates; and (4) startle test\&mdash;a ball was suddenly thrown on the ground in front of the horse. HR data was collected every five s throughout each three min test. Eyelid movements and behaviours were retrospectively determined from video recordings. A generalized linear mixed model (GLIMMIX) procedure with Sidak\&rsquo;s multiple comparisons of least squares means demonstrated that both full blinks (16 \&plusmn; 12b vs. 15 \&plusmn; 15b vs. 13 \&plusmn; 11b vs. 26 \&plusmn; 20a full blinks/3 min \&plusmn; SEM; a,b differ p \&lt; 0.006) and half blinks (34 \&plusmn; 15ab vs. 27 \&plusmn; 14bc vs. 25 \&plusmn; 13c vs. 42 \&plusmn; 22a half blinks/3 min \&plusmn; SEM; a,b,c differ p \&lt; 0.0001) decreased during feed restriction, separation and the startle test compared to the control, respectively. Eyelid twitches occurred more frequently in feed restriction (p \&lt; 0.0001) along with an increased HR (p \&lt; 0.0001). This study demonstrates that spontaneous blink rate decreases while eyelid twitches increase when the horse experiences a stressful situation.},

A total of 270 animals died during the period with 80\% of them being under 1 year old. The mortality rate for under 1 year olds was 54\%, while the odds of survival of cubs within a litter increased if the dam had had litters previously. Survival to reproductive age was 44\%. Post-mortem reports were requested and the cause of death was obtained for 133 animals. Trauma inflicted by a conspecific and lack of care were common causes of death (26\% and 22\%, respectively) and were also responsible for most of the neonatal mortalities. Congenital defects were responsible for 9\% of deaths, although the true prevalence is likely underestimated. A common necropsy protocol for all Asiatic lion collections is needed to facilitate future studies. Zoo Biol. 36:66–73, 2017. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

What has yet to be established, however, are the precise characteristics of behavioral coordination that give rise to such effects. Informed by a dynamical systems approach, the current investigation considered whether judgments of rapport are influenced by the mode of interpersonal synchrony. In two experiments, participants rated the degree of rapport manifest by a simulated pair of walkers exhibiting various configurations of synchronized strides. The results revealed that the highest levels of rapport were associated with the most stable forms of interpersonal coordination (i.e., in-phase and anti-phase synchrony), regardless of whether coordination between the walkers was conveyed via the presentation of visual (Expt. 1a) or auditory (Expt. 1b) cues. These findings underscore the importance of interpersonal coordination to core aspects of social perception. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Modern day zoos and aquariums continuously assess the welfare of their animals and use evidence to make informed management decisions. Historically, many of the indicators of animal welfare used to assess the collection are negative indicators of welfare, such as stereotypic behavior. However, a lack of negative indicators of animal welfare does not demonstrate that an individual animal is thriving. There is a need for validated measures of positive animal welfare and there is a growing body of evidence that supports the use of behavioral diversity as a positive indicator of welfare. This includes an inverse relationship with stereotypic behavior as well as fecal glucocorticoid metabolites and is typically higher in situations thought to promote positive welfare. This review article highlights previous research on behavioral diversity as a potential positive indicator of welfare. Details are provided on how to calculate behavioral diversity and how to use it when evaluating animal welfare. Finally, the review will indicate how behavioral diversity can be used to inform an evidence-based management approach to animal care and welfare.},

However, in modern times, such interactions between inflammation and the brain appear to drive the development of depression and may contribute to non-responsiveness to current antidepressant therapies. Recent data have elucidated the mechanisms by which the innate and adaptive immune systems interact with neurotransmitters and neurocircuits to influence the risk for depression. Here, we detail our current understanding of these pathways and discuss the therapeutic potential of targeting the immune system to treat depression.},

  abstract = {Connectivity of habitat patches is thought to be important for movement of genes, individuals, populations, and species over multiple temporal and spatial scales. We used graph theory to characterize multiple aspects of landscape connectivity in a habitat network in the North Carolina Piedmont (U.S.A). We compared this landscape with simulated networks with known topology, resistance to disturbance, and rate of movement. We introduced graph measures such as compartmentalization and clustering, which can be used to identify locations on the landscape that may be especially resilient to human development or areas that may be most suitable for conservation. Our analyses indicated that for songbirds the Piedmont habitat network was well connected. Furthermore, the habitat network had commonalities with planar networks, which exhibit slow movement, and scale-free networks, which are resistant to random disturbances. These results suggest that connectivity in the habitat network was high enough to prevent the negative consequences of isolation but not so high as to allow rapid spread of disease. Our graph-theory framework provided insight into regional and emergent global network properties in an intuitive and visual way and allowed us to make inferences about rates and paths of species movements and vulnerability to disturbance. This approach can be applied easily to assessing habitat connectivity in any fragmented or patchy landscape.},

  abstract = {This paper studies parameters of a lactation curve such as peak yield (PY) and persistency (P), which do not conform to the usual selection criteria in the Murciano-Granadina (MG) breed, but are considered to be an alternative to benefit animal welfare without reducing production. Using 315,663 production records (of 122,883 animals) over a period of 24 years (1990\&ndash;2014), genetic parameters were estimated with uni-, bi- and multivariate analysis using multiple trait derivative free restricted maximum likelihood (MTDFREML). The heritability (h2)/repeatability (re) of PY, yield (Y) and P was estimated as 0.13/0.19, 0.16/0.25 and 0.08/0.09 with the uni-trait and h2 of bi- and multi-traits analysis ranging from 0.16 to 0.17 of Y, while that of PY and Y remained constant. Genetic correlations were high between PY\&ndash;Y (0.94 \&plusmn; 0.011) but low between PY\&ndash;P (\&ndash;0.16 \&plusmn; 0.054 to \&ndash;0.17 \&plusmn; 0.054) and between Y\&ndash;P (\&ndash;0.06 \&plusmn; 0.058 to \&ndash;0.05 \&plusmn; 0.058). Estimates of h2/re were low to intermediate. The selection for Y\&ndash;PY or both can be implemented given the genetic correlation between these traits. PY\&ndash;P and Y\&ndash;P showed low to negligible correlation values indicating that if these traits are implemented in the early stages of evaluation, they would not be to the detriment of PY\&ndash;Y. The combination of estimated breeding values (EBVs) for all traits would be a good criterion for selection.},

  abstract = {Case-control studies of antenatal drug exposure and birth defects often rely on maternal recall of drug use in pregnancy. Differential recall among mothers of cases and controls can lead to information bias ("maternal recall bias"), and the opportunity for such bias increases as ascertainment of drug exposure diminishes. The effect of questionnaire design on the ascertainment of drug use in pregnancy was examined in two studies. In a pilot interview study of 532 women in obstetric/gynecologic practices, information on drug use in the past year was obtained by means of three questions asked in sequence: The first question was open-ended, the second asked about drug use for selected indications, and the third asked about use of specifically named drugs. Among obstetric patients who reported use of any of five drugs, less than 50\% did so in response to the open-ended question, and approximately 20-40\% reported use only when the specific drug name was asked. In a case-control Birth Defects Study of 5,435 mothers of malformed children, information on drug use in pregnancy was obtained by asking questions in sequence about indications and specifically named drugs. Among the women who reported use of any of 11 drugs, 6-40\% did so only when asked about the specific drug by name. These findings suggest that completeness of ascertainment of antenatal drug exposure varies according to how the mother is questioned and is directly related to the specificity of the questions asked.},

Assessments of changes in behavior were made by comparing categorized observer comments. Animals moved to cages having more visitors increased their aggressive displays toward people, decreased their aggressive displays toward other species in neighboring cages, and increased their withingroup aggression. On the other hand, grooming, sexual behavior, and play increased after cage changes regardless of numbers of visitors. The view that it is the pattern of behavior changes in enrichment that is important in assessment of attempted enrichment was supported. Aggressive and affiliative behaviors are affected quite differently by different environmental stimuli in the zoo.},

  abstract = {We report the first draft of the whole genome assembly of a male Asiatic lion, Atul and whole transcriptomes of five Asiatic lion individuals. Evaluation of genetic diversity placed the Asiatic lion in the lowest bracket of genomic diversity index highlighting the gravity of its conservation status. Comparative analysis with other felids and mammalian genomes unraveled the evolutionary history of Asiatic lion and its position among other felids. The genome is estimated to be 2.3 Gb (Gigabase) long with 62X sequence coverage and is found to have 20,543 protein-coding genes. About 2.66\% of the genome is covered by simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and 0.4\% is estimated to have segmental duplications. Comparison with seven well annotated genomes indicates the presence of 6,295 single copy orthologs, 4 co-orthologs, 21 paralogs uniquely present in Asiatic lion and 8,024 other orthologs. Assessment of male and female transcriptomes gave a list of genes specifically expressed in the male. Our genomic analyses provide candidates for phenotypes characteristic to felids and lion, inviting further confirmation of their contribution through population genetic studies. An Asiatic lion-specific expansion is detected in the Cysteine Dioxygenase-I (CDO-I) family that is responsible for taurine biosynthesis in cats. Wilm's tumor-associated protein (WT1) family, a non-Y chromosome genetic factor underlying male-sex determination and differentiation is found to have undergone expansion, interestingly like that of the human genome. Another protein family, translation machinery-associated protein 7 (TMA7) that has undergone expansion in humans, also expanded in Asiatic lion and can be further investigated as a candidate responsible for mane in lions because of its role in hair follicle morphogenesis.}

  abstract = {During the symposium “Ecosystem Services at the Landscape Scale” from the EU-IALE conference 2009, several challenges for future research on approaches to use the concept of ecosystem services at the landscape scale were identified, focussing on the need for integration. Three main research directions were discussed, (i) the definition of the potentials and limitations of the ecosystem service approach for landscape analysis, (ii) the identification of suitable methods and tools to apply the ecosystem service approach at the landscape scale and (iii) the demand of incorporating ecosystem and landscape services in decision making and management. This paper briefly addresses and discusses some of these topics and puts them into a broader perspective. From this viewpoint it becomes obvious that many high-quality sectoral studies are carried out, e.g. concentrating on specific services or specific linkages within the “ecosystem service cascade” which describes the relation between biophysical characteristics of the landscape, their functions, services, benefits and values for society. In order to provide useful information for decision makers, ecosystem services studies should be supplemented by investigations of the whole systems of interactions between ecological processes and societal valuations.},

When anticipating a positive reward, silver foxes were more active, performed more stereotypical behaviour, had more erected ears and spent more time in the front of the cage compared to anticipating aversive stimuli. Foxes were only to a minor degree able to discriminate the two different positive paradigms. In conclusion, studies related to anticipatory behaviour may be useful for the development of indicators of positive emotional states and, thus, positive welfare, in farmed silver foxes. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {1. Predators affect prey by killing them directly (lethal effects) and by inducing costly antipredator behaviours in living prey (risk effects). Risk effects can strongly influence prey populations and cascade through trophic systems. A prerequisite for assessing risk effects is characterizing the spatiotemporal variation in predation risk. 2. Risk effects research has experienced rapid growth in the last several decades. However, pre-liminary assessments of the resultant literature suggest that researchers characterize predation risk using a variety of techniques. The implications of this methodological variation for infer-ence and comparability among studies have not been well recognized or formally synthesized. 3. We couple a literature survey with a hierarchical framework, developed from established theory, to quantify the methodological variation in characterizing risk using carnivore–ungu-late systems as a case study. Via this process, we documented 244 metrics of risk from 141 studies falling into at least 13 distinct subcategories within three broader categories. 4. Both empirical and theoretical work suggest risk and its effects on prey constitute a com-plex, multi-dimensional process with expressions varying by spatiotemporal scale. Our survey suggests this multi-scale complexity is reflected in the literature as a whole but often underap-preciated in any given study, which complicates comparability among studies and leads to an overemphasis on documenting the presence of risk effects rather than their mechanisms or scale of influence. 5. We suggest risk metrics be placed in a more concrete conceptual framework to clarify inference surrounding risk effects and their cascading effects throughout ecosystems. We rec-ommend studies (i) take a multi-scale approach to characterizing risk; (ii) explicitly consider 'true' predation risk (probability of predation per unit time); and (iii) use risk metrics that facilitate comparison among studies and the evaluation of multiple competing hypotheses. Addressing the pressing questions in risk effects research, including how, to what extent and on what scale they occur, requires leveraging the advantages of the many methods available to characterize risk while minimizing the confusion caused by variability in their application.},

I tested experimentally how deception is controlled in such a status signalling system. In aviaries, experimentally dyed birds were involved in more aggressive encounters than controls. Active encounters made up a similar fraction of all interactions involving experimental and control birds. Dyed sparrows did not win relatively more encounters than controls. Experimental house sparrows were involved in more aggressive encounters with conspecifics having larger throat patches than expected whereas controls interacted with conspecifics with a throat patch size that did not deviate from expectation. The throat patch size of winning contestants was larger than that of losing birds both within and between experimental and control groups. Dyed house sparrows did not achieve higher dominance rank than controls. Cheating in the status signalling system is thus controlled socially by frequent challenges of house sparrows having large throat patches},

Male house sparrows were more frequently engaged in attacks with males having a similar badge size when they had large badges than when they had small ones. Badge size did not change consistently with age. Breeding territory owners approached closer to, and moved less frequently in response to, a house sparrow model with a small badge than to one with a large badge.

  abstract = {Many domestic dogs are uncomfortable when humans perform trivial and benign actions that the animals perceive as threatening. A common technique for addressing canine emotional discomfort involves desensitization, where the intensity of a problematic stimulus is gradually increased while the dog remains relaxed. Desensitization requires a skillful owner and is complicated when actions of the owner are the stimuli to be desensitised. This paper introduces a behaviour modification programme for dogs with impaired social functioning in relation to the (inter)actions by their owners, consisting of (1) increasing owner knowledge and awareness regarding dog body language and perception of owner actions, (2) management of the daily life of the dog through general stress reduction and avoidance of stressful situations, and (3) behaviour modification through training. The latter component entails a non-threatening, predictable exercise in which the dog has control over any perceived threats, the introduction of the safety cue with subsequent desensitization, and engaging activities with the owner that the dog finds enjoyable. We also present a case series report to examine a selection of dogs with impaired social functioning, from signalment to outcome, when treated with the proposed behaviour modification and examine which adaptations were made to the plan according to individual dogs. Finally, we avenues for future research.},

  abstract = {Despite some populations of European wildcat Felis silvestris in central Europe are stable or increasing, the Iberian subpopulation is in decline and is listed as ‘vulnerable’. In Portugal, little is known about wildcat populations, making conservation policies extremely difficult to define. Furthermore, the secretive behaviour of these mammals, along with low population densities, make data collection complicated. Thus, it is crucial to develop efficient analytical tools to interpret existing data for this species. In this study, we determine the home-range size and environmental factors related to wildcat spatial ecology in a Mediterranean ecosystem using a combined analysis of habitat selection and maximum entropy (Maxent) modelling. Simultaneously, we test the feasibility of using radio-tracking locations to construct an ecologically meaningful distribution model. Six wildcats were captured and tracked. The average home-range size (MCP95) was 2.28 km2 for females and 13.71 km2 for one male. The Maxent model built from radio-tracking locations indicated that the abundance of the European rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus and limited human disturbance were the most important correlates of wildcat presence. Habitat selection analysis revealed that wildcats tend to use scrubland areas significantly more than expected by chance. A mosaic of scrublands and agricultural areas, with a higher proportion of the former, benefits wildcat presence in the study area; however, species distribution is mainly constrained by availability of prey and resting sites. The Maxent model validation with camera-trapping data indicated that highly adequate model performance. This technique may prove useful for recovering small radio-tracking datasets as it provides a new alternative for handling data and maximizing the ecological information on a target population, which can then be used for conservation planning.},

In addition, confinement-specific stressors such as restricted movement, reduced retreat space, forced proximity to humans, reduced feeding opportunities, maintenance in abnormal social groups, and other restrictions of behavioral opportunity are considered. Research in support of the claims for these environmental elements as stressors for captive animals reveals no unique suite of behavioral or physiological responses that will clearly indicate the cause of those responses; rather, it is up to us as managers and caretakers of animals in captivity to evaluate enclosures and husbandry practices to ensure the optimal well-being of animals in our care. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {[Extract] Interpretation aims to stimulate interest, promote learning, guide visitors in appropriate behaviour for sustainable tourism and encourage enjoyment and satisfaction. This chapter discusses the role of interpretation in sustainable wildlife tourism. For the purpose of this chapter the term wildlife tourism will be restricted to activities, attractions and tours that involve non-consumptive wildlife viewing or interaction opportunities. There is very little information available on the role of interpretation in consumptive wildlife activities such as hunting or fishing. A review of interpretive methods is provided and international examples are used to illustrate the potential roles of interpretation in wildlife tourism settings. Some issues specific to the practice of interpreting wildlife are discussed. A review of evaluation research in the area of wildlife interpretation will also demonstrate that little specific research is available and that there has been virtually no theoretical discussion of how to design effective wildlife interpretation. The authors have been involved in a long running program of interpretation evaluation and wildlife tourism research. This chapter presents a conceptual model based on both this research and theories from educational and social psychology. This mindfulness model is presented to assist readers' understanding of how to design interpretation that attracts attention and fosters learning and enjoyment.},

  abstract = {During middle childhood, children develop an increasing understanding of intentions and other social information conveyed through dynamic facial cues such as changes in eye-gaze direction. Recent work in our laboratory has focused on using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in adults to map the neural circuitry subserving the visual analysis of others' actions and the intentions underlying these actions. In these studies, the superior temporal sulcus (STS) region has been continually implicated in processing shifts in eye gaze. Further, these studies have indicated that STS activity is modulated by the context within which eye-gaze shifts occur, suggesting that this region is involved in social perception via its role in the analysis of the intentions of observed actions. Still, no studies have investigated the neural circuitry supporting eye-gaze processing in children. We used event-related fMRI to examine brain activity in 7- to 10-year-old healthy children observing an animated virtual actor who shifted her eyes towards either a target object or empty space. Consistent with prior studies in adults, the STS, middle temporal gyrus, and inferior parietal lobule were sensitive to the intentions underlying the stimulus character's eye movements. These findings suggest that the neural circuitry underlying the processing of eye gaze and the detection of intentions conveyed through shifts in eye gaze in children are similar to that found previously in adults. We discuss these findings and potential implications for mapping the neurodevelopment of the social cognition and social perception abnormalities characteristic of autism. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {The provision of high-quality conservation education has become a priority for modern zoos. This can be delivered in a number of differing ways to account for differences in learning styles and prior knowledge of zoo visitors. At Chester Zoo (United Kingdom), a team of full-time and highly trained interpreters (known as pre- senters) deliver a diverse public talks program every day of the year. Although these talks attract a large audience, little was understood about their impact on the visitor. As a result, an extensive, unobtrusive study using video recording equipment was un- dertaken to assess visitor behavior. Results suggest that visitor attentivenesswasmuch higher among those individuals who found themselves in a better viewing position (where they could see the animal and presenter). Visitors who were in poor-visibility positions showed less attention than visitors who were observed under control con- ditions, without an accompanying talk, indicating a high environmental component to learning potential. When interactive elements were included in a talk (such as an animal feed or enrichment activity) attentiveness was dramatically increased. More crucially, however, was that during talks where there was no interactivity or animals were inactive, attentiveness fell to below control levels, suggesting that heightened visitor expectations created by the anticipation for the talk were not being met—a serious barrier to learning. These findings offer a series ofmeasures that can be taken to improve the educational impact of a zoo talks program whilst, at the same time, providing a better quality experience for zoo visitors.},

Outside of "formal" education initiatives, such as those designed for school and other organized groups, or structured public talks programmes, much of the learning potential that the zoo has to offer is around the viewing of animals and the response of visitors to them. In this, zoo learning is a very personal construct, develops from the previous knowledge, and experiences and motivations of each individual. In this article, we make the assertion that learning potential, although difficult to quantify, is very much related to the attractiveness of animal species and the interest that visitors show in them. Using standard behaviorist measures of attraction and interest (the proportion of visitors that stop and for how long), we analyzed the relative interest in 40 zoo species held in a modern UK zoo and the variables that are significant in predicting that popularity. Further to this, the suggestion is made that the zoo collection planning process could use such information to make more informed decisions about which species should be housed for their educational value. Taxonomic grouping was found to be the most significant predictor of visitor interest--that is, visitors were far more interested in mammals than any other group--although body size (length), increasing animal activity and whether the species was the primary or "flagship" species in an exhibit or not, were all found to have a significant bearing on visitor interest.},

During stress, various endocrine responses are involved to improve the fitness of the individual. The front-line hormones to overcome stressful situations are the glucocorticoids and catecholamines. These hormones are determined as a parameter of adrenal activity and thus of disturbance. The concentration of glucocorticoids (or their metabolites) can be measured in various body fluids or excreta. Above all, fecal samples offer the advantage that they can be easily collected and this procedure is feedback free. Recently, enzyme immunoassays (EIA) have been developed and successfully tested, to enable the measurement of groups of cortisol metabolites in animal feces. The determination of these metabolites in fecal samples is a practical method to monitor glucocorticoid production.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Comparative phylogeography links historical population processes to current/ecological processes through congruent/incongruent patterns of genetic variation among species/lineages. Despite high biodiversity, India lacks a phylogeographic paradigm due to limited comparative studies. We compared the phylogenetic patterns of Indian populations of jungle cat (Felis chaus) and leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis). Given similarities in their distribution within India, evolutionary histories, body size and habits, congruent patterns of genetic variation were expected. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We collected scats from various biogeographic zones in India and analyzed mtDNA from 55 jungle cats (460 bp NADH5, 141 bp cytochrome b) and 40 leopard cats (362 bp NADH5, 202 bp cytochrome b). Jungle cats revealed high genetic variation, relatively low population structure and demographic expansion around the mid-Pleistocene. In contrast, leopard cats revealed lower genetic variation and high population structure with a F(ST) of 0.86 between North and South Indian populations. Niche-model analyses using two approaches (BIOCLIM and MaxEnt) support absence of leopard cats from Central India, indicating a climate associated barrier. We hypothesize that high summer temperatures limit leopard cat distribution and that a rise in temperature in the peninsular region of India during the LGM caused the split in leopard cat population in India. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results indicate that ecological variables describing a species range can predict genetic patterns. Our study has also resolved the confusion over the distribution of the leopard cat in India. The reciprocally monophyletic island population in the South mandates conservation attention.},

Biological and social research show that protectionism is successful in the conservation of large mammals but fails to capture diverse species communities; extractivism is appropriate for some resources but not for others; protected-area outreach can be effective for some communities; and devolved control over wildlife, in conjunction with ecotourism and citizen science, has considerable potential in the area. The long-term nature of the research provides the necessary time frame to evaluate outcomes of different conservation strategies, uncovers dynamics within communities that affect attitudes and responses to conservation initiatives, provides impartial recommendations because changing research personnel offers different viewpoints, and, probably most importantly, enhances trust among stakeholders. Currently, there are limited institutional mechanisms for ensuring the input of biological and social science in shaping conservation practice in Tanzania, and long-term research can help informally bridge the gap.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Despite growing evidence of the adverse health effects of social disadvantage on minority populations, few studies have investigated whether such effects extend to alcohol problems. This study examines social disadvantage as a source of stress and analyzes its association with alcohol use and problems in the three largest racial/ethnic groups in the United States.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHOD: Data on white, black, and Hispanic Americans (n = 6,631) were obtained from the 2005 U.S. National Alcohol Survey, a nationally representative telephone-based survey of adults ages 18 and older. Social disadvantage was measured by poverty level, frequency of unfair treatment, racial/ethnic stigma consciousness, and cumulative disadvantage. Outcomes included drinking status, at-risk drinking, and problem drinking.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: Blacks and Hispanics reported greater exposure to social disadvantage than whites, including greater poverty, unfair treatment, racial/ethnic stigma, and cumulative disadvantage. In all three racial/ethnic groups, exposure to disadvantage was associated with problem drinking. Frequent unfair treatment, high racial stigma (among minorities), and multiple sources of extreme disadvantage corresponded to a twofold to sixfold greater risk of alcohol problems, partially explained by psychological distress.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: These results are consistent with other studies of stress and adverse health consequences associated with social disadvantage. Although there is a clear disparity in exposure to such hardship, experiences of disadvantage appear to have similar effects on problem drinking among both racial/ethnic minorities and whites. Future research should attempt to assess causal directions in the relationships among social and economic hardship, stress, and alcohol problems.},

Female students' alcohol use was unrelated to their academic, family, dating, or social satisfaction. Drinking among men showed a positive, curvilinear relation to social satisfaction but was unrelated to other domains of LS. Alcohol-related problems were associated with decreased LS among both men and women. These findings suggest that alcohol use by young adults is associated with both positive and negative outcomes that may be gender specific.},

  abstract = {The General Factor of Personality improves our understanding of the personality structure and the relations between major personality dimensions, as well as major dimensions of the entire non-cognitive sphere of psychological variables. The results of the empirical testing and theoretical evaluations in this book contribute to the more comprehensive and precise theoretical framework of the General Factor of Personality (GFP) and that of the entire personality structure. Additionally, the book answers some unresolved questions concerning the nature of the GFP, including whether it is based more on correlations in real behavior or on other less substantial factors between lower-order dimensions of personality. This book is crucially important not only for theoretical reasons, but also for the tremendous practical and applied value of the assumed general dimension of personality. As a common denominator of all the most important fields of personality beyond cognition (Big Five, well-being, coping, emotionality, motivation, self-concept, self-esteem, control, wisdom and others), the GFP represents an extremely strong single predictor of the quality of life, mental health and well-being, career, academic success, and the quality of family and interpersonal relations. Reviews the theoretical and methodological work on the General Factor of Personality (GFP). Presents major research results in the field of GFP and the dimensional structure of personality. Provides a balanced and objective approach to the topic of GFP, addressing criticisms and controversies. Considers the practical and applied aspects of this research. Draws conclusions on the bioevolutionary model of GFP to give a more thorough understanding of biological bases of human personality. © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Central to many behavioural and ecological studies is the need to record the movements and performance of freeliving animals. The challenge of making such measurements is particularly acute in marine settings where animals are often submerged and/or far from shore, making direct observations difficult. Consequently, animal- borne electronic devices now play a crucial role in studies of marine vertebrates. However, there is currently a marked dichotomy in the types of behavioural data that can be collected using these devices. On the one hand, data loggers have expanded massively in memory and the range of parameters they can measure. For example, data are now routinely being collected on depth (Laidre et al. 2003), water temperature (Metcalfe \& Arnold 1997), animal swim speed, acceleration/flipper beat frequency (Williams et al. 2000; Wilson et al. 2002) and compass heading (Davis et al. 2003). Furthermore, a range of logging visual-imaging syste s provide a view of an animals behaviour in relation to its immediate environment (e.g. Takahashi et al. 2004; Reina et al. 2005). A key limitation of these archival devices is that they must be recovered in order to obtain data. This makes them suitable for studies on species that will return to predictable locations (e.g. during the breeding season, seals and penguins return to provision offspring) or if used in onjunction with other devices to facilitate recovery (e.g. popoff systems and VHF transmitters). On the other hand, to obtain information from animals that move large distances and where instrument recovery is not possible, the standard technique is to use the Argos satellite system (http://www.argosinc.com). Behavioural data relayed remotely via the Argos satellite system are constrained by the limited bandwidth available, with transmissions (uplinks) limited to 256 bits of data and a typical interval of 40200 s between transmissions depending on the application. To put these values into a more accessible context, if a single depth value was sent as an 8-bit number, only 32 depth values could be sent in a single uplink, even without any information on the timing of each depth reading. However, typically depth will be recorded every few seconds to examine dive profiles, so that in a single day many thousands of depth values will be recorded. Furthermore, many marine vertebrates spend most of their time submerged, further limiting the time available for communication with satellites. The problem readily becomes apparent: devices can record data at a much faster rate than can be relayed via the Argos system. For many years this limited bandwidth has meant that even routinely collected data on temperature, depth and dive duration have had to be grouped into bins prior to transmission or simply averaged (Hughes et al. 1998). To circumvent the limited bandwidth of Argos, novel compression techniques for relaying both temperature and depth data have been developed to allow reconstruction of temperature and depth profiles (Fedak et al. 2002). We attempted to validate this approach by simultaneously deploying two instruments on to a deepdiving marine animal, the leatherback turtle, Dermochelys coriacea: a satellite tag incorporating these on-board compression techniques along with a traditional timedepth recorder (TDR).},

At Time 1 (T1), the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) and Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) were distributed. At Time 2 (T2), the SDS was distributed again. The T2 SDS score was positively correlated with Harm Avoidance and negatively correlated with Reward Dependence and Self-directedness at T1. However, after controlling for the T1 SDS score, the T2 SDS score was predicted only by T1 Self-directedness. These data suggest that lower Self-directedness can be predictive of depression, whereas higher Harm Avoidance and lower Reward Dependence are state-dependent.},

Participants completed a baseline survey evaluating eating and activity patterns, sleep, and stress and measures of height, weight, waist circumference, and body fat.Results: Participants were primarily female (68\%), white (73\%), with a mean age of 22.8~years, and 66.2\% reporting an annual income {$<$} \$12,000. Almost half (47\%) were overweight or obese. Young males appeared to engage the most in risky health behaviors and had higher levels of overweight or obesity, compared with young females.Conclusions: Findings confirm the need for innovative interventions targeting this understudied and underserved young adult population.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT The survival of animal species and individuals is largely determined by their ability to express physiological stress responses to predictable and unpredictable environmental challenges. Currently, there is no empirical evidence presenting the stress endocrine responses of female frogs during breeding between different reproductive groups. In this study, non-invasive urine sampling and standard capture and handling protocol were used to quantify baseline and short-term corticosterone stress responses in vitellogenic and non-vitellogenic female Fijian ground frog (Platymantis vitiana) during the annual breeding period. Urinary estrogen and progesterone metabolites were also quantified in the same frog urine samples. Repeated sampling of the female frogs (n?=?20) on three occasions enabled repeatability (r) of reproductive and stress hormones to be quantified. All female frogs generated urinary corticosterone responses to the standard capture and handling stressor. Both baseline and short-term corticosterone responses were significantly higher in magnitude in the vitellogenic females in comparison to the non-vitellogenic female frogs. Vitellogenic females also showed significantly higher levels of urinary estrogen and progesterone metabolites in comparison to the non-vitellogenic females. Baseline urinary corticosterone, short-term corticosterone responses, urinary estrogen, and progesterone metabolites were highly repeatable for both female groups. The results highlight the importance of reproductive and stress hormones during the breeding period in female ground frogs. Future studies should determine the role of potential biological stressors (such as interactions with invasive species) that could be mediating the observed differences in stress endocrine responses of the vitellogenic and non-vitellogenic female frogs.

  abstract = {Tigers have lost 93\% of their historical range worldwide. India plays a vital role in the conservation of tigers since nearly 60\% of all wild tigers are currently found here. However, as protected areas are small ({$<$}300\,km2 on average), with only a few individuals in each, many of them may not be independently viable. It is thus important to identify and conserve genetically connected populations, as well as to maintain connectivity within them. We collected samples from wild tigers (Panthera tigris tigris) across India and used genome-wide SNPs to infer genetic connectivity. We genotyped 10,184 SNPs from 38 individuals across 17 protected areas and identified three genetically distinct clusters (corresponding to northwest, southern and central India). The northwest cluster was isolated with low variation and high relatedness. The geographically large central cluster included tigers from central, northeastern and northern India, and had the highest variation. Most genetic diversity (62\%) was shared among clusters, while unique variation was highest in the central cluster (8.5\%) and lowest in the northwestern one (2\%). We did not detect signatures of differential selection or local adaptation. We highlight that the northwest population requires conservation attention to ensure persistence of these tigers.},

  abstract = {"Of all the literature I use while preparing field guides for the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Nelson's Fishes of the World is, by far, the one I refer to most often. This book is a standard reference . . . I continue to use it extensively in the ichthyology courses I teach, particularly in laboratory sessions." -Kent E. Carpenter Old Dominion University "Fishes of the World is a unique and essential resource for anyone seriously interested in the diversity and evolution of fishes. The family accounts provide quick summaries of current knowledge on all groups of living fishes and many key fossil taxa. It is a required work for every student in my laboratory." -William E. Bemis Kingsbury Director of Shoals Marine Laboratory, Cornell University "Only classics are known by the single name of their author, and certainly Nelson's book has for four editions been such a book for all those who seek an accessible, up-to-date, readable reference on fish classification. Once again, Nelson presents a balanced view of the sometimes tumultuous, but ever-exciting, study of the phylogenetic relationships and classification of fishes. In doing so, Nelson makes an excellent case for organismal biology, highlighting the many and varied morphological characters we use to diagnose fish taxa and differentiate among the 515 families of living species." -Lynne R. Parenti Curator of Fishes and Research Scientist, National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution Fishes of the World, Fourth Edition is the updated edition of a true classic in the field. A unique presentation of a modern, cladistically based classification of all the major living and fossil fish groups, this indispensable reference helps scientists and others identify and classify specimens, make familial connections, understand the evolution of fishes, and springboard into further research. The taxonomy of fishes presented includes the anatomical characteristics, distribution, common and scientific names, and phylogenetic relationships for all 515 families of living fishes. Packed with representative species drawings and information on phylogentic relationships, this informative Fourth Edition features: Both fossil and extant species More than 500 illustrations Fully vetted scientific and common names An extensive bibliography},

  abstract = {Aim Predators often have important roles in structuring ecosystems via their effects on each other and on prey populations.However, these effectsmay be altered in the presence of anthropogenic food resources, fuelling debate about whether the availability of such resources could alter the ecological role of predators. Here, we review the extent to which human-provided foods are utilised by terrestrial mam- malian predators ({$>$} 1 kg) across the globe.We also assess whether these resources have a direct impact on the ecology and behaviour of predators and an indirect impact on other co-occurring species. Location Global. Methods Data were derived from searches of the published literature. To sum- marise the data we grouped studies based on the direct and indirect effects of resource subsidies on predators and co-occurring species.We then compared the types of predators accessing these resources by grouping species taxonomically and into the following categories: (1) domesticated species, (2) mesopredators and (3) top predators. Results Human-provided foods were reported to be utilised by 36 terrestrial predator species in 34 different countries. In the presence of these resources we found that: (1) predator abundance increased, (2) the dietary preferences of preda- tors altered to include the food subsidy, (3) life-history parameters such as survival, reproduction and sociality shifted to the benefit or detriment of the predator, and (4) predators changed their home ranges, activity and movements. In some instances, these modifications indirectly affected co-occurring species via increased predation or competition. Main conclusions The availability of human-provided food to predators often results in behavioural or population-induced changes to predators and trophic cascades.We conclude that there is an urgent need to reduce the access of predators to food subsidies to minimise human–wildlife conflicts and to preserve the integ- rity of ecosystem functioning in human-influenced landscapes world-wide.},

  abstract = {A unique and essential feature of germ cells is their immortality. In Caenorhabditis elegans, germline immortality requires the maternal contribution from four genes, mes-2, mes-3, mes-4 and mes-6. We report here that mes-2 encodes a protein similar to the Drosophila Polycomb group protein, Enhancer of zeste, and in the accompanying paper that mes-6 encodes another Polycomb group protein. The Polycomb group is responsible for maintaining proper patterns of expression of the homeotic and other genes in Drosophila. It is thought that Polycomb group proteins form heteromeric complexes and control gene expression by altering chromatin conformation of target genes. As predicted from its similarity to a Polycomb group protein, MES-2 localizes to nuclei. MES-2 is found in germline nuclei in larval and adult worms and in all nuclei in early embryos. By the end of embryogenesis, MES-2 is detected primarily in the two primordial germ cells. The correct distribution of MES-2 requires the wild-type functions of mes-3 and mes-6. We hypothesize that mes-2 encodes a maternal regulator of gene expression in the early germline; its function is essential for normal early development and viability of germ cells.},

One-hundred-and-three crushing events were analysed in eight batches concerning sows\&rsquo; posture changes that crushed piglets and age of crushed piglets. Posture change frequency, amounts of single posture changes and total time spent in different body postures were evaluated for 41 sows (14 FC-sows, 13 LH-sows and 14 GH-sows) in six batches. Litter behaviour (location, active/inactive scoring, resting behaviour next to the sow) was analysed during sows\&rsquo; posture changes and piglet crushing. Piglet mortality was higher in LH (25.6\%) and GH (19.9\%) compared to FC (12.3\%) due to higher levels of piglet crushing. Most crushing occurred during the three days postpartum in LH (92.7\%) and GH (83.9\%). However, crushing patterns differed between LH (rolling: 68.2\%; sit-to-lie: 18.2\%; stand-to-lie: 11.4\%) and GH (rolling: 38.2\%; sit-to-lie: 30.9\%; stand-to-lie: 16.4\%) and varying piglet behaviour may be the cause for this. The postpartum period was characterized by inactivity of the sow and behavioural differences were rarely seen between systems.},

Among 825 female cattle \&gt;353 days of age admitted to a Danish abattoir, 187 (23\%) were found to be pregnant. There was no apparent difference in the proportion of pregnant animals between dairy and non-dairy cattle. \&ldquo;Health\&rdquo;-related slaughter was most frequent in dairy herds (70\%), whereas \&ldquo;production\&rdquo;-related slaughter was most frequent in non-dairy herds (63\%). While many farmers considered it unethical to slaughter pregnant cows without a good reason for doing so, many dairy farmers identified animal welfare as an important parameter in the decision, which was typically when the general condition of the cow or heifer would make it difficult for her to pass through calving and subsequent lactation. The many pregnant animals sent for slaughter were often the result of deliberate choices. Non-dairy farmers often kept a bull with their female cattle, and in many instances, this resulted in the mating of cattle intended for slaughter. Although considered ethically problematic by many dairy farmers, the slaughter of pregnant dairy cattle was often considered better for the cow compared to a stressful lactation period.},

  abstract = {Many studies report that copper can be used to control microbial growth, including that of viruses. We determined the rates of copper-mediated inactivation for a wide range of bacteriophages. We used two methods to test the effect of copper on bacteriophage survival. One method involved placing small volumes of bacteriophage lysate on copper and stainless steel coupons. Following exposure, metal coupons were rinsed with lysogeny broth, and the resulting fluid was serially diluted and plated on agar with the corresponding bacterial host. The second method involved adding copper sulfate (CuSO(4)) to bacteriophage lysates to a final concentration of 5 mM. Aliquots were removed from the mixture, serially diluted, and plated with the appropriate bacterial host. Significant mortality was observed among the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) bacteriophages Φ6 and Φ8, the single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) bacteriophage PP7, the ssDNA bacteriophage ΦX174, and the dsDNA bacteriophage PM2. However, the dsDNA bacteriophages PRD1, T4, and λ were relatively unaffected by copper. Interestingly, lipid-containing bacteriophages were most susceptible to copper toxicity. In addition, in the first experimental method, the pattern of bacteriophage Φ6 survival over time showed a plateau in mortality after lysates dried out. This finding suggests that copper's effect on bacteriophage is mediated by the presence of water.},

METHODS: The anti-inflammatory and skin protective properties of panthenol, PEA and NAM were evaluated in vitro. The physical properties of the AR formulations were analysed using measurement of water vapour transport rate (WVTR) and infrared spectroscopy. Clinical studies were performed between the months of December and April (2014-15) with efficacy assessed during the winter. Facial redness, irritation, sensitization potential, photo-irritation, and photo-sensitization were evaluated. Self-assessed adverse reactions were reported in diaries of use. RESULTS: Panthenol and PEA reduced prostaglandin E2 , interleukin-6, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin levels in vitro, while NAM induced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) levels and the keratinocyte differentiation markers: filaggrin (2-fold increase, p {$<$} 0.001), loricrin (2-fold increase, p {$<$}0.05), involucrin (2 fold increase, p {$<$} 0.001) \& peroxisomal proliferator activated receptor-alpha (1.5 fold increase, p {$<$} 0.05). The two AR products exhibited low WVTR (include changes and stats) and displayed an ordered lipid structure. The day cream formulation protected against ultraviolet B radiation in vitro. A total of 382 participants were included in clinical studies which showed the AR formulations significantly improved facial redness associated with winter xerosis (include improvements and stats). No irritation, sensitization, photo-irritation, photo-sensitization or product-related adverse reactions were observed or reported in the clinical studies. CONCLUSION: The new products significantly improved skin redness associated with winter xerosis in participants with self-perceived sensitive skin. Both products were well tolerated with a suitable safety profile for topical use in subjects with sensitive skin. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The endangered Asiatic lion (Panthera leo persica) is currently distributed as a single wild population of 670 individuals and ∼400 captive animals globally. Although the captive lions are major hope for the species’ long-term conservation through repatriation, their welfare status and management practises need research attention. To this end, we tested the efficacy of feeding, sensory and manipulable enrichment interventions on the welfare of Asiatic lions at the conservation breeding centre of Sakkarbaug Zoological Garden, Gujarat. We adopted a holistic approach by measuring physiological and behavioural responses of 35 captive Asiatic lions, divided into control (n=16) and test (n=19) groups. The test subjects approached feeding devices first and manipulable devices for a longer duration. Manipulable devices were used homogenously with two significant time peaks, but sensory devices were used sporadically throughout the day with no discernible peak usage. The control subjects remained unchanged in all welfare parameters compared to their pre-treatment levels. However, post-enrichment behavioural assessments showed higher behaviour diversity (95\% increase from the baseline period), reduced enclosure zone bias (40.25\% reduction) and aberrant repetitive behaviours (80.68\%) in test samples. Similarly, faecal corticosterone measures showed lower stress levels in test samples (58\% decrease), confirming significant improvement in all welfare indices than control groups. These results have universal applicability to assess welfare indices of other captive species in Indian zoos. We hope that the results will encourage zoo managers and regulatory agencies to improve animal welfare practices.},

  abstract = {Capturing human anatomy is a lifelong pursuit.  A great first step in that journey, as well as a fun daily warm-up, is gesture sketching. There are many different approaches to quick-pose sketching, and this video explains a 'constructive anatomy' technique. Based largely on the methods of Andrew Loomis, this technique combines observational sketching with memorized anatomy to capture poses in less than one minute. To give this exercise a try, grab your sketchbook and open up www.posemaniacs.com.  Though the default time interval is 30 seconds, I'd recommend selecting 60 seconds.  Remember: the goal is learning, not creating beautiful drawings.

  abstract = {Animal personality research is receiving increasing interest from related fields, such as evolutionary personality psychology. By merging the conceptual understanding of personality, the contributions to both fields of research may be enhanced. In this study, we investigate animal personality based on the definition of personality traits as underlying dispositional factors, which are not directly measurable, but which predispose individuals to react through different behavioural patterns. We investigated the shyness-boldness continuum reflected in the consistency of inter-individual variation in behavioural responses towards novelty in 47 farmed American mink (Neovison vison), which were raised in identical housing conditions. Different stages of approach behaviour towards novelty, and how these related within and across contexts, were explored. Our experimental design contained four tests: two novel object tests (non-social contexts) and two novel animated stimuli tests (social contexts). Our results showed consistency in shyness measures across multiple tests, indicating the existence of personality in farmed American mink. It was found that consistency in shyness measures differs across non-social and social contexts, as well as across the various stages in the approach towards novel objects, revealing that different aspects of shyness exist in the farmed American mink. To our knowledge this is the first study to reveal aspects of the shyness-boldness continuum in the American mink. Since the mink were raised in identical housing conditions, inherited factors may have been important in shaping the consistent inter-individual variation. Body weight and sex had no effect on the personality of the mink. Altogether, our results suggest that the shyness-boldness continuum cannot be explained by a simple underlying dispositional factor, but instead encompasses a broader term of hesitating behaviour that might comprise several different personality traits.},

  abstract = {In recent years, awareness of the controversial aspects connected with wild animal-visitor interactions (AVIs) in zoos and other facilities has increased due to cultural changes. Therefore, the need to apply transparent procedures to evaluate AVIs programs in zoos and similar facilities has also increased. This study presents results of animal welfare’s assessment of a pilot test of a protocol based on six steps that aim to explore and assess the overall value of AVIs considering the impact both on animals and visitors. In the present paper, we discuss the multifaceted approach to animal welfare assessment during animal-visitor interactions, combining quantitative behavioural observations/analysis and a welfare risk-assessment procedure, which forms the basis of the six-step protocol. Pilot testing of said approach to animal welfare assessment involved giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis) in an Italian zoo. No change in behaviour, suggestive of an increased welfare risk to the animals, was found. The risk analysis reported overall low risks for welfare, whereas enclosure analysis highlighted that the enclosure was suitable for allowing interactions without jeopardising animal welfare, mainly because it allowed animals to choose whether to interact or withdraw from interactions without decreasing the space available to them.},

We investigated the influence of multiple variables on the quantity of DNA extracted from faecal samples from wild mountain gorillas and chimpanzees. There was a small negative correlation between temperature at time of collection and the amount of DNA obtained. Storage of samples either in RNAlater solution or dried using silica gel beads produced similar results, but significantly higher amounts of DNA were obtained using a novel protocol that combines a short period of storage in ethanol with subsequent desiccation using silica.},

A population decline of {$>$}95\%, starting in the 1990s, was first noted at Keoladeo National Park, India. Since then, catastrophic declines, also involving Gyps indicus and Gyps tenuirostris, have continued to be reported across the subcontinent. Consequently these vultures are now listed as critically endangered by BirdLife International. In 2000, the Peregrine Fund initiated its Asian Vulture Crisis Project with the Ornithological Society of Pakistan, establishing study sites at 16 OWBV colonies in the Kasur, Khanewal and Muzaffargarh-Layyah Districts of Pakistan to measure mortality at over 2,400 active nest sites. Between 2000 and 2003, high annual adult and subadult mortality (5-86\%) and resulting population declines (34-95\%) (ref. 5 and M.G., manuscript in preparation) were associated with renal failure and visceral gout. Here, we provide results that directly correlate residues of the anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac with renal failure. Diclofenac residues and renal disease were reproduced experimentally in OWBVs by direct oral exposure and through feeding vultures diclofenac-treated livestock. We propose that residues of veterinary diclofenac are responsible for the OWBV decline.},

  abstract = {When predators are removed or suppressed for generations, prey populations tend to increase and when predators are re-introduced, prey densities should fall back to pre-control levels. In cases of apparent competition where there are alternate abundant and rare prey species, rare species may decline further than expected or disappear altogether. Recently, concern about the impact of recovering predator populations on wildlife in Laikipia County, Kenya, has led to questions of whether lions (Panthera leo, IUCN Red List Vulnerable) exert top-down pressure on Grevy’s zebra (Equus grevyi, IUCN Red List Endangered). We examined effects of lion predation on Plain’s zebra (E. quagga, IUCN Red List Near Threatened) and Grevy’s zebra populations in a 2,105 km2 area defined by lion movements. We used line transect surveys to estimate density of Grevy’s (0.71/km2) and Plain’s (15.9/km2) zebras, and satellite telemetry to measure movements for lions and both zebras. We tracked lions to potential feeding sites to estimate predation rates on zebras. We compared field-based estimates of predation rates on both zebras to random gas models of encounters that result in predation to ask if lions prey preferentially on Grevy’s zebra at a sufficient rate to drive population declines. Lions preyed on Grevy’s zebra significantly less than expected in 15 of 16 (94\%) scenarios considered and lions preyed on Plain’s zebras as expected or significantly less than expected in 15 of 16 scenarios. Population trend of Grevy’s zebra indicates that the Kenya population may be stabilizing. Recruitment rate to the population has tripled since 2004, making it unlikely that lions are having an impact on Grevy’s zebras. In Laikipia County, competitive displacement by livestock (Livestock: Grevy’s zebra ratio = 864:1) and interference competition for grass with Plain’s zebra (Plain’s zebra:Grevy’s zebra ratio = 22:1) are most likely the predominant threats to Grevy’s Zebra recovery.},

  abstract = {The Asiatic lion (Panthera leo persica) exists in the wild as a single relict population of approximately 250 individuals in the protected Gir Forest Sanctuary in western India. In 1981, a species survival plan (SSP) for the Asiatic lion was established by the American Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums to manage the 200 + descendants of Asiatic lions in captivity in western zoological facilities. This captive population was derived from seven founders. In order to compare the genetic structure of the Gir Forest population with that of the captive SSP population, a genetic survey of 46 electrophoretic allozyme systems resolved from extracts of lion blood was undertaken by using 29 SSP Asiatic lions and 28 wild‐caught or captive‐bred lions maintained at the Sakkarbaug Zoo in India but originally derived from the Gir Forest. The Gir lion population was found to be genetically monomorphic at each of 46 allozyme loci. This was in contrast to several African lion (Panthera leo leo) populations, which show moderate levels of allozyme variation at the same loci. The SSP lion population was polymorphic at three allozyme loci (IDHI, TF, and PTI) for alleles that were previously found only in African lion populations. Pedigree analysis of the genetic transmission of these three biochemical loci demonstrated that two of the five primary founder animals of the SSP Asiatic lion population (a breeding pair originally imported from the Trivandrum Zoo in southern India) were descendants of the African subspecies. Three other founder animals were pure Asian. A retrospective SSP pedigree analysis of two morphologic characters (prominent abdominal fold and pairing of infraorbital foramen) that are partially diagnostic for persica vs leo was consistent with this conclusion as well. The implications for the management of small captive populations of threatened species and of the Asiatic lion SSP population are discussed. Copyright © 1987 Wiley‐Liss, Inc., A Wiley Company},

Differences have been found for several personality traits in a range of species. In great tits these traits have a genetic basis and are phenotypically correlated. Estimates of genetic correlations are, however, fundamental to understanding the evolution of consistent individual differences in behavior. This study analyzed two selection experiments on two avian personality traits, early exploratory behavior and risk-taking behavior. The selection lines used were both started using wild great tits (Parus major) from two natural populations. Genetic correlations were calculated using the response and the correlated response to artificial selection. We found genetic correlations ranging from 0.51 to 0.66, based on individual values, and from 0.84 to 1.00 based on nest means. Genetic correlations can be due to pleiotropic effects or to linkage disequilibrium. The different behavioral traits might therefore have a common genetic basis, possibly constraining independent evolution of personality traits in natural populations. These results are discussed in relation to domain generality and domain specificity of personalities.},

  abstract = {The role of inbreeding depression in the extinction of wild populations is controversial, largely because there are no quantitative estimates of its impact using realistic levels of inbreeding depression. To address this deficiency, this study (1) provides a comprehensive estimate of the impact of inbreeding depression on wild, mammalian and avian species via a meta-analysis, and (2) determines the impact of this level of inbreeding depression on extinction risk over a broad taxonomic range via stochastic computer projections with and without inbreeding depression for populations with carrying capacities of 100, 500 and 2000 individuals. An average overall effect of 12 diploid lethal equivalents was found across the life-history of the species in the meta-analysis. In the stochastic computer projections, 12 diploid lethal equivalents of inbreeding depression (with purging) decreased median times to extinction by an average of 37\%. These decreases were significant and of very similar magnitude, regardless of the carrying capacity modelled. Disregarding the influence of inbreeding depression on extinction risk will lead to serious overestimates of the survival prospects of threatened mammalian and avian taxa. Further, inappropriate recovery plans may be instituted if the causes of extinction risk and their relative contributions are not recognized.},

  abstract = {The use of animals in biomedical and other research presents an ethical dilemma: we do not want to lose scientific benefits, nor do we want to cause laboratory animals to suffer. Scientists often refer to the potential human benefits of animal models to justify their use. However, even if this is accepted, it still needs to be argued that the same benefits could not have been achieved with a mitigated impact on animal welfare. Reducing the adverse effects of scientific protocols ('refinement') is therefore crucial in animal-based research. It is especially important that researchers share knowledge on how to avoid causing unnecessary suffering. We have previously demonstrated that even in studies in which animal use leads to spontaneous death, scientists often fail to report measures to minimize animal distress (Olsson et al. 2007). In this paper, we present the full results of a case study examining reports, published in peer-reviewed journals between 2003 and 2004, of experiments employing animal models to study the neurodegenerative disorder Huntington's disease. In 51 references, experiments in which animals were expected to develop motor deficits so severe that they would have difficulty eating and drinking normally were conducted, yet only three references were made to housing adaptation to facilitate food and water intake. Experiments including end-stages of the disease were reported in 14 papers, yet of these only six referred to the euthanasia of moribund animals. If the reference in scientific publications reflects the actual application of refinement, researchers do not follow the 3Rs (replacement, reduction, refinement) principle. While in some cases, it is clear that less-than-optimal techniques were used, we recognize that scientists may apply refinement without referring to it; however, if they do not include such information in publications, it suggests they find it less relevant. Journal publishing policy could play an important role: first, in ensuring that referees seriously consider whether submitted studies were indeed carried out with the smallest achievable negative impact on the animals and, secondly, in encouraging scientists to share refinements through the inclusion of a 3Rs section in papers publishing the results of animal-based research.},

If our efforts in reforming education for all students are to succeed, then we must focus on students. To date, a focus on student-centered learning may well be the most important contribution of constructivism. This article, therefore, discusses constructivism learning theory as a paradigm for teaching and learning. Constructivism is a learning theory found in psychology which explains how people might acquire knowledge and learn. It therefore has direct application to education. The theory suggests that humans construct knowledge and meaning from their experiences. Conceptual understanding of the theory was discussed as well as basic characteristics of constructivists learning environment. Seven pedagogical goals of constructivist learning environments and six benefits of constructivism were outlined in this article. Significant differences between traditional classroom and constructivist classroom were spelt out in a tabular form. Furthermore,principles of constructivism and several implications of constructivism for teaching and learningwere reviewed. The study, therefore, concluded that teachers need to reflect on their practice in order to apply these ideas to their work and that constructivist teachers encourage students to constantly assess how the activity is helping them gain understanding.},

This study examined the prevalence of procrastination on statistics assignments among graduate students and the relationship between academic procrastination and six dimensions of statistics anxiety. Participants were 135 graduate students enrolled in 3 sections of a required introductory-level educational research course at a southeastern university. Findings reveal that a high percentage of students reported problems with procrastination on writing term papers, studying for examinations, and completing weekly reading assignments. Overall academic procrastination was significantly positively related to the following dimensions of statistics anxiety: interpretation anxiety, tests class anxiety and fear of asking for help. A canonical correlation analysis reveals that academic procrastination resulting from both fear of failure and task aversiveness was related significantly to the worth given to statistics, interpretation anxiety, test and class anxiety, computational self-concept, fear of asking for help, and fear of the statistics instructor. Implications for statistics anxiety reduction as a procrastination intervention are discussed.},

  abstract = {Bushmeat represents an important source of animal protein for humans in tropical Africa. Unsustainable bushmeat hunting is a major threat to wildlife and its consumption is associated with an increased risk of acquiring zoonotic diseases, such as Ebola virus disease (EVD). During the recent EVD outbreak in West Africa, it is likely that human dietary behavior and local attitudes toward bushmeat consumption changed in response to the crisis, and that the rate of change depended on prevailing socio-economic conditions, including wealth and education. In this study, we therefore investigated the effects of income, education, and literacy on changes in bushmeat consumption during the crisis, as well as complementary changes in daily meal frequency, food diversity and bushmeat preference. More specifically, we tested whether wealthier households with more educated household heads decreased their consumption of bushmeat during the EVD crisis, and whether their daily meal frequency and food diversity remained constant. We used Generalized Linear Mixed Models to analyze interview data from two nationwide household surveys across Liberia. We found an overall decrease in bushmeat consumption during the crisis across all income levels. However, the rate of bushmeat consumption in high-income households decreased less than in low-income households. Daily meal frequency decreased during the crisis, and the diversity of food items and preferences for bushmeat species remained constant. Our multidisciplinary approach to study the impact of EVD can be applied to assess how other disasters affect social-ecological systems and improve our understanding and the management of future crises.},

We show that the Kruskal-Wallis (K-W) rank test can be extended to test for such effects. Let B = b1 . . . bh be the tested effect, and A = a1 . . . ag be the effect imme- diately above it in the hierarchy. If one calculates separate K-W statistics for the effect B at each level of A, then under H0 for B, the sum of all these statistics is asymptotically χ2 h−g. This test is demonstrated using a well- known experimental economics dataset. We also show that the Friedman test can be extended in a similar fashion for designs that are both nested and crossed. In general, the preferable inference approach is using the label permutation distribution rather than the asymptotic distribution. Codes for carrying out such tests have been implemented and are available.},

Positive differentiation, even of trivial groups, has been explained in terms of a striving for a positive social identity (Tajfel and Turner, 1986). The present study questions this interpretation by providing evidence for the implicit activation of positive affect toward novel in-groups. A minimal group setting was combined with a typical paradigm measuring spontaneous trait inferences (STIs). Results show that behaviors that implied positive traits about an in-group member were more likely to be categorized in a manner consistent with the implied trait than when (a) the behaviors were performed by an out-group member and (b) the traits implied were negative. There was no facilitation of trait inference to out-group members performing negative behaviors (i.e., there was evidence for implicit in-group favoritism but not out-group derogation). © 2000 Academic Press.},

  abstract = {Survival and successful reproduction require animals to make critical decisions amidst a naturally dynamic environmental and social background (i.e., ‘context’). However, human activities have pervasively, and rapidly, extended contextual variation into evolutionarily novel territory, potentially rendering evolved animal decision making mechanisms and strategies maladaptive. We suggest that explicitly focusing on animal decision making (ADM), by integrating and applying findings from studies of sensory ecology, cognitive psychology, behavioral economics and eco-evolutionary strategies, may enhance our understanding of, and our ability to predict how, human driven changes in the environment and population demography will influence animal populations. Fundamentally, the decisions animals make involve evolved mechanisms, and behaviors emerge from the combined action of sensory integration, cognitive mechanisms, and strategic rules of thumb, and any of these processes may have a disproportionate influence on behavior. Although there is extensive literature exploring ADM, it generally reflects a canalized, discipline-specific approach that lacks a unified conceptual framework. As a result, there has been limited application of ADM theory and research findings into predictive models that can enhance management outcomes, even though it is likely that the relative resilience of species to rapid environmental change is fundamentally a result of how ADM is linked to contextual variation. Here, we focus on how context influences ADM, and highlight ideas and results that may be most applicable to conservation biology.This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved},

We relate African lion population densities and population trends to contrasting management practices across 42 sites in 11 countries. Lion populations in fenced reserves are significantly closer to their estimated carrying capacities than unfenced populations. Whereas fenced reserves can maintain lions at 80\% of their potential densities on annual management budgets of \$500~km(-2) , unfenced populations require budgets in excess of \$2000~km(-2) to attain half their potential densities. Lions in fenced reserves are primarily limited by density dependence, but lions in unfenced reserves are highly sensitive to human population densities in surrounding communities, and unfenced populations are frequently subjected to density-independent factors. Nearly half the unfenced lion populations may decline to near extinction over the next 20-40~years.},

The free-choice learning offered in these settings is closely linked to visitors' intrinsic motivation, making it important to understand the motivational factors that impact on visitors' experiences. This paper presents data from a questionnaire administered to visitors at three sites: a museum, an art gallery, and an aquarium. Similarities and differences among the sites are reported in relation to visitors' expectations, perceptions of learning opportunities, engagement in motivated learning behaviors, and perceptions of the learning experience.

  abstract = {Trophy hunting is one of the most controversial issues in the field of biodiversity conservation. In particular, proponents and opponents debate fiercely over whether it poses a threat to hunted populations. Here, we show that trophy hunting constitutes a greater menace to threatened species than previously realized. Because humans value rarity, targeted species that are threatened are likely to be disproportionately hunted, thereby becoming even more vulnerable, which could eventually push them to extinction. With the ten felid species currently hunted for their trophies, we present evidence that (1) the number of killed individuals increases with time, in several cases exponentially, despite population declines, (2) the price of trophies is strongly dependent on species protection status, (3) changes of protection status coincide with counter-intuitive changes of hunting pressures: protection intensification with augmented hunting effort, and protection relaxation with lower effort. This suggests an over-exploitation of trophy-hunted felids and the necessity of a better quota system coupled with reconsidered protection methods.},

  abstract = {The processes leading up to species extinctions are typically characterized by prolonged declines in population size and geographic distribution, followed by a phase in which populations are very small and may be subject to intrinsic threats, including loss of genetic diversity and inbreeding [1]. However, whether such genetic factors have had an impact on species prior to their extinction is unclear [2, 3]; examining this would require a detailed reconstruction of a species' demographic history as well as changes in genome-wide diversity leading up to its extinction. Here, we present high-quality complete genome sequences from two woolly mammoths (Mammuthus primigenius). The first mammoth was sequenced at 17.1-fold coverage and dates to ∼4,300 years before present, representing one of the last surviving individuals on Wrangel Island. The second mammoth, sequenced at 11.2-fold coverage, was obtained from an ∼44,800-year-old specimen from the Late Pleistocene population in northeastern Siberia. The demographic trajectories inferred from the two genomes are qualitatively similar and reveal a population bottleneck during the Middle or Early Pleistocene, and a more recent severe decline in the ancestors of the Wrangel mammoth at the end of the last glaciation. A comparison of the two genomes shows that the Wrangel mammoth has a 20\% reduction in heterozygosity as well as a 28-fold increase in the fraction of the genome that comprises runs of homozygosity. We conclude that the population on Wrangel Island, which was the last surviving woolly mammoth population, was subject to reduced genetic diversity shortly before it became extinct.},

However, although sampling is relatively easy to perform and free of feedback, a careful consideration of various factors is necessary to achieve proper results that lead to sound conclusions. This article aims to provide guidelines for an adequate application of these techniques. It is meant as a checklist that addresses the main topics of concern, such as sample collection and storage, time delay extraction procedures, assay selection and validation, biological relevance, and some confounding factors. These issues are discussed briefly here and in more detail in other recent articles.},

When I wrote this book in 1989,I felt that there was a need for an up-to-date account ofwhat is known about the history of vertebrates,but also for a summary of the latest of these exciting discoveries. The first edition was published in 1990. The second edition, substantially modified, appeared in 1997. It offered extensive cover- age of the new discoveries of the early 1990s, as well as comprehensive cladistic coverage of the main verte- brate clades. Since 1990, the book has hopped from publisher to publisher: it was commissioned by Unwin Hyman, who were soon after acquired by Harper Collins, and their science list was in turn acquired by Chapman \& Hall, so the first edition appeared under three publishers’ logos, in 1990, 1991 and 1995. The second edition appeared with Chapman \& Hall, but they were then taken over by Kluwer,and this book was marketed by their Stanley Thornes subsidiary for a while, before passing to Blackwell Science in 2000. I hope these wandering days are now over.},

We hypothesized that anti-preeclamptic drugs that combat the action of sFlt-1 may reduce BEV's anti-tumor efficacy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 3D co-cultured human mini-tumors consisting of endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and cancer cells were developed. The influence of anti-preeclamptic drugs and BEV on the invasion of mini-tumors embedded in collagen gel was evaluated. RESULTS: Mini-tumor spheroids that contained MDA-MB-231 cells showed higher invasion ability than spheroids with A549. Among the six anti-preeclamptic drugs investigated, only nicorandil enhanced the invasion of mini-tumors and inhibited the action of BEV. Glibenclamide, an ATP-sensitive potassium channel inhibitor, completely quenched the action of nicorandil on mini-tumors. CONCLUSION: In the human mini-tumor model, nicorandil aggravated the invasion of mini-tumors. These data raise the possibility that concomitant use of nicorandil counteracts the efficacy of BEV therapy.},

  abstract = {While the negative consequences of alcohol use in college students are well known, less is known about the relationships of these consequences to alcohol consumption patterns. Further, almost no research has been conducted examining students' positive alcohol-related consequences. The current study examines the nature and frequency of positive and negative alcohol-related consequences, the relationship of these consequences to alcohol consumption patterns, and the impact of these consequences on subsequent drinking intentions. Findings indicate that college student drinking does indeed involve many negative consequences, some of which are quite serious, but that students also experience many positive consequences. In fact, they report their encounters with positive consequences as being more extreme and more frequent than their encounters with negative consequences. Further, consuming more alcohol is related to experiencing more positive and more negative consequences, as well as more extremely positive positive encounters, but not more extremely negative negative ones. Finally, participants reported that their positive and negative consequences would influence their future drinking decisions in a number of different ways. Future research directions and implications for interventions are discussed. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Traditionally, statistical training has focused primarily on mathematical derivations and proofs of statistical tests. The process of developing the technical artifact—that is, the paper, dashboard, or other deliverable—is much less frequently taught, presumably because of an aversion to cookbookery or prescribing specific software choices. In this paper I argue that it’s critical to teach analysts how to go about developing an analysis in order to maximize the probability that their analysis is reproducible, accurate, and collaborative. A critical component of this is adopting a blameless postmortem culture. By encouraging the use of and fluency in tooling that implements these opinions, as well as a blameless way of correcting course as analysts encounter errors, we as a community can foster the growth of processes that fail the practitioners as infrequently as possible.},

  abstract = {Longitudinal studies of a binary outcome are common in the health, social, and behavioral sciences. In general, a feature of random effects logistic regression models for longitudinal binary data is that the marginal functional form, when integrated over the distribution of the random effects, is no longer of logistic form. Recently, Wang and Louis (2003) proposed a random intercept model in the clustered binary data setting where the marginal model has a logistic form. An acknowledged limitation of their model is that it allows only a single random effect that varies from cluster to cluster. In this paper, we propose a modification of their model to handle longitudinal data, allowing separate, but correlated, random intercepts at each measurement occasion. The proposed model allows for a flexible correlation structure among the random intercepts, where the correlations can be interpreted in terms of Kendall's τ. For example, the marginal correlations among the repeated binary outcomes can decline with increasing time separation, while the model retains the property of having matching conditional and marginal logit link functions. Finally, the proposed method is used to analyze data from a longitudinal study designed to monitor cardiac abnormalities in children born to HIV-infected women.},

In the latter, optimality leads to the efficient transmission of information with a minimum number of connections. Whilst studies show that differences in centrality exist in animal networks with central individuals having higher fitness, network efficiency has never been studied in animal groups. Here we studied 78 groups of primates (24 species). We found that group size and neocortex ratio were correlated with network efficiency. Centralisation (whether several individuals are central in the group) and modularity (how a group is clustered) had opposing effects on network efficiency, showing that tolerant species have more efficient networks. Such network properties affecting individual fitness could be shaped by natural selection. Our results are in accordance with the social brain and cultural intelligence hypotheses, which suggest that the importance of network efficiency and information flow through social learning relates to cognitive abilities.},

  abstract = {Human-Animal Relationships (HAR) in zoos develop from repeated interactions between animals and their caretakers. HAR have been shown to affect health and welfare in farm animals, but limited zoo-based studies exist. This study investigates the association between the qualitative behaviour assessment (QBA) of emotional expression in giraffes and keeper action score in four types of keeper-animal interaction (KAI). Three giraffes generating 38 clips. QBA, using a free-choice profiling methodology, was applied instructing 18 observers to assess giraffe expressions shown in these clips. QBA scores were analysed using Generalized Procrustes Analysis. Keeper actions during each KAI event were rated by an independent marker, resulting in cumulative scores for keeper action quality. The association between QBA and the keeper action was analyzed using Spearman\&rsquo;s rank correlations. Two main QBA dimensions were identified explaining 59\% of the variation between clips. There were significant effects of giraffe and KAI type on QBA dimension 2 (inquisitive/impatient\&mdash;calm/distracted), and significant positive associations between keeper action quality rating and QBA dimensions 1 and 2, indicating that positive keeper actions resulted in calm and confident giraffes with a willingness to interact. This is the first successful application of QBA for empirically addressing HARs in zoos, however given the small sample size of giraffes in this study, it can be regarded as a pilot study only, and further research is needed to validate the use of QBA in this context.},

The aim of this study was to develop a noninvasive method for recording nocturnal activity in aquatic decapods and test the accuracy of analysis by video tracking software. We selected crayfish, Cherax destructor, because they are often active at night, they live underwater, and data on their locomotion is important for answering biological and physiological questions such as how they explore and navigate. We constructed recording arenas and filmed animals in infrared light. Wethen compared human observer data and software-acquired values. In this article, we outline important apparatus and software issues to obtain reliable computer tracking.},

However, this theory is not easy to test empirically, as exact measures of parental investment in an experimental set-up are difficult to obtain. We have used free-ranging dogs Canis familiaris in India, to study POC in the context of extended parental care. We observed females and their pups in their natural habitat for the mother's tendency to share food given by humans with her pups in the weaning and post-weaning stages. Since these dogs are scavengers, and depend largely on human provided food for their sustenance, voluntary sharing of food by the mother with her pups is a good surrogate for extended parental care. Our behavioural observations convincingly demonstrate an increase of conflict and decrease of cooperation by the mother with her offspring over given food within a span of 4-6 weeks. We also demonstrate that the competition among the pups in a litter scales with litter size, an indicator of sib-sib competition. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

We identified the 7th - 13th week period of pup age as the zone of conflict between the mother and her pups, beyond which suckling solicitations cease, and before which suckling refusals are few. We also report for the first time milk theft by pups who take advantage of the presence of multiple lactating females, due to the promiscuous mating system of the dogs. This behaviour, though apparently disadvantageous for the mothers, is perhaps adaptive for the dogs in the face of high mortality and competition for resources.},

Physiological parameters were referenced to additional measurements made following exhaustive exercise in a static tank and aerobic exercise in a swim tunnel. Maximum speeds maintained exclusively using a steady gait in the raceway ranged from 53.6 to 97.3 cm s(-1) and scaled positively with fish length. Minimum swimming speeds maintained exclusively through recruitment of an unsteady gait were also positively correlated to fish length and ranged from 81.4 to 122.9 cm s(-1). Fish switched between steady and unsteady swimming at intermediate speeds. Smallmouth bass always maintained a positive ground speed in the raceway; however, those that primarily swam using a steady gait to overcome low to moderate water velocities (20-50 cm s(-1)) maintained mean ground speeds of approximately 20 cm s(-1). By contrast, mean ground speeds of fish that primarily recruited an unsteady locomotory gait increased significantly with water velocity, which resulted in an inverse relationship between exercise intensity and duration. We interpret this behaviour as evidence that unsteady swimming was being fuelled by the limited supply of anaerobic substrates in the white muscle. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that unsteady swimming fish showed significantly lower muscle glycogen levels, higher lactate concentrations (muscle and plasma) and higher post-exercise oxygen consumption rates compared with fish that used a steady gait. The reduction in passage time achieved by fish using an unsteady gait allowed them to ascend the raceway with relatively minor post-exercise metabolic imbalances, relative to individuals chased to exhaustion.},

Here we review the value of long-term pedigrees and associated phenotypic data of captive stocks for evolutionary research and conservation programs.

  abstract = {An explication of the neural substrates for social perception is an important component in the emerging field of social cognitive neuroscience and is relevant to the field of cognitive neuroscience as a whole. Prior studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that passive viewing of biological motion (Pelphrey, Mitchell, et al., 2003; Puce et al., 1998) activates the posterior superior temporal sulcus (STS ) region. Furthermore, recent evidence has shown that the perceived context of observed gaze shifts (Pelphrey, Singerman, et al., 2003; Pelphrey et al., 2004) modulates STS activity. Here, using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging at 4 T, we investigated brain activity in response to passive viewing of goal- and nongoal-directed reaching-to-grasp movements. Participants viewed an animated character making reaching-to-grasp movements either toward (correct) or away (incorrect) from a blinking dial. Both conditions evoked significant posterior STS activity that was strongly right lateralized. By examining the time course of the blood oxygenation level-dependent response from areas of activation, we observed a functional dissociation. Incorrect trials evoked significantly greater activity in the STS than did correct trials, while an area posterior and inferior to the STS (likely corresponding to the MT/ V5 complex) responded equally to correct and incorrect movements. Parietal cortical regions, including the superior parietal lobule and the anterior intraparietal sulcus, also responded equally to correct and incorrect movements, but showed evidence for differential responding based on the hand and arm (left or right) of the animated character used to make the reaching-to-grasp movement. The results of this study further suggest that a region of the right posterior STS is involved in analyzing the intentions of other people's actions and that activity in this region is sensitive to the context of observed biological motions.},

  abstract = {Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we investigated brain activity evoked by mutual and averted gaze in a compelling and commonly experienced social encounter. Through virtual-reality goggles, subjects viewed a man who walked toward them and shifted his neutral gaze either toward (mutual gaze) or away (averted gaze) from them. Robust activity was evoked in the superior temporal sulcus (STS) and fusiform gyrus (FFG). For both conditions, STS activity was strongly right lateralized. Mutual gaze evoked greater activity in the STS than did averted gaze, whereas the FFG responded equivalently to mutual and averted gaze. Thus, we show that the STS is involved in processing social information conveyed by shifts in gaze within an overtly social context. This study extends understanding of the role of the STS in social cognition and social perception by demonstrating that it is highly sensitive to the context in which a human action occurs.

A majority of students did not report NMPD use: 39.4\% of respondents reported lifetime NMPD use, 31\% reported past-year use, and 14.4\% reported past-month use. Multivariate regression results partially supported social learning theory as an explanation for lifetime NMPD use. Limitations and suggestions for future research are suggested.},

Though these findings have been challenged previously, this paper draws attention to the most significant shortcoming in claims of early domesticated dogs - a lack of data on Pleistocene wolf variation. Without comprehensive data on the range of variation within Pleistocene wolf populations, the identification of domesticated dogs from prior to the Late Upper Paleolithic cannot be conclusively accepted or rejected.},

  abstract = {The relationship between parents styles of talking about past events with their children and childrens recall of stressful events was explored. In this investigation, 2- to 5-year-old childrens recall of injuries requiring hospital emergency room treatment was assessed within a few days of the injury and again 2 years later, along with the way their parents reminisced with them about the event. Correlational analyses showed that age and parental reminiscing style were consistently related to child memory; regression analyses showed that although age was most important, parents who were more elaborative had children who recalled more during their initial interview about the harder- to-remember hospital event. Thus, an elaborative parental style may help childrens recall of even highly salient and stressful events.},

Canine parvovirus (CPV-2) was probably influential during the crash, but it disappeared by the late 1980s. High mortality abruptly ceased after 1988, but low recruitment in the absence of disease and obvious shortage of food prevented recovery of the wolf population. In 1983-1995, with a comparable number of moose ≥10 years old as potential prey, wolves were only half as numerous as in 1959-1980. A simulation of annual fluctuations in effective population size (Ne) for wolves on Isle Royale suggests that their genetic heterozygosity has declined ca. 13\% with each generation and ca. 80\% in the 50-year history of this population. Inbreeding depression and stochastic demographic variation both remain possible explanations for recent low recruitment.},

This tenet, restated as a hypothesis, is rejected based on moose population response to a chronic wolf decline. In 1980-1996 with wolf numbers down, partly due to introduced disease, moose numbers increased to a historic high level. There was insufficient density dependence in moose reproduction and mortality to stabilize moose numbers. In 1996 moose suffered a crash; 80\% died, primarily from starvation. These fluctuations, along with the possibility that the highly inbred wolf population may become extinct, will challenge NPS policy. The long-standing NPS management tradition of nonintervention may not be compatible with the current policy that stresses maintenance of natural ecological processes, such as a predator-prey system.},

  abstract = {A number of studies have focused on the spread of foraging innovations within animal populations, but only rarely have individual dispositions of becoming innovative been considered. With two groups of individually marked, hand-reared greylag goslings we investigated hormonal and behavioural correlates related to the individual's ability to perform operant tasks. During individual tests 6 weeks after hatching, goslings were given small food containers covered by lids. In the following winter the sibling groups were tested in a social set-up at a food dispenser, which the geese could activate by pulling a flap. We analysed individual faecal samples collected at 2, 6 and 12 weeks of age, and also after the individual tests, for excreted corticosterone and testosterone metabolites by enzyme immunoassay. During the individual test, 18 of 23 individuals learned to remove the lids. These 18 birds excreted higher faecal corticosterone concentrations than their respective controls 2 weeks after hatching. At the food dispensers, only four males became food producers; all the others scrounged. These four were in the group of 18 that were successful in the individual test and again tended, although not significantly, to have higher faecal corticosterone 2 weeks after hatching than the scroungers. In one of the groups, excreted corticosterone increased and excreted testosterone decreased after the individual test. Goslings successfully removing lids at 6 weeks raised their faecal corticosterone to a significantly greater extent than the unsuccessful individuals. Our results suggest that becoming an innovator may be contingent upon individual coping styles. Copyright 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Therefore, they may not only provide information about the sex (if both sexes are calling) but also about the condition of the caller. This paper provides a description of the acoustic features of roars recorded from 18 male and 6 female lions (Panthera leo) living in the Serengeti National park, Tanzania. After analyzing whether these roars differ between the sexes, tests whether male roars may function as indicators of their fighting ability or condition were conducted. Therefore, call characteristics were tested for relation to anatomical features as size, mane color, or mane length. Call characteristics included acoustic parameters that previously had been implied as indicators of size and fighting ability, e.g., call length, fundamental frequency, and peak frequency. The analysis revealed differences in relation to sex, which were entirely explained by variation in body size. No evidence that acoustic variables were related to male condition was found, indicating that sexual selection might only be a weak force modulating the lion's roar. Instead, lion roars may have mainly been selected to effectively advertise territorial boundaries.},

The response of the agricultural industry in bringing forward new technology such as reduced application rates of targeted pesticides with lower toxicity and persistency is noted.

In vertebrates the enzyme exists in three isoforms: alpha, beta and gamma. The amino-acid and nucleotide sequences deposited in the GenBank and SwissProt databases were subjected to analysis using the following bioinformatic programs: ClustalX, GeneDoc, MEGA2 and S.I.F.T. (sort intolerant from tolerant). Phylogenetic trees of enolases created with the use of the MEGA2 program show evolutionary relationships and functional diversity of the three isoforms of enolase in vertebrates. On the basis of calculations and the phylogenetic trees it can be concluded that vertebrate enolase has evolved according to the "birth and death" model of evolution. An analysis of amino acid sequences of enolases: non-neuronal (NNE), neuron specific (NSE) and muscle specific (MSE) using the S.I.F.T. program indicated non-uniform number of possible substitutions. Tolerated substitutions occur most frequently in alpha-enolase, while the lowest number of substitutions has accumulated in gamma-enolase, which may suggest that it is the most recently evolved isoenzyme of enolase in vertebrates.},

The underlying pathological changes are heterogeneous and are characterised by various intraneuronal inclusions. Biomarkers to detect these histopathological changes in life are becoming increasingly important with the development of disease-modifying drugs. Gene mutations have been found that collectively account for around 10-20\% of cases. Recently, criteria proposed for bvFTD define three levels of diagnostic certainty: possible, probable, and definite. Detailed history taking from family members to elicit behavioural features underpins the diagnostic process, with support from neuropsychological testing designed to detect impairment in decision making, emotion processing, and social cognition. Brain imaging is important for increasing the level of diagnostic certainty. A recently developed staging instrument shows much promise for monitoring patients and evaluating therapies, which at present are aimed at symptom amelioration.

The goal of the Social Cognition Psychometric Evaluation (SCOPE) study is to identify and improve the best existing measures of social cognition so they can be suitably applied in large-scale treatment studies. Initial phases of this project sought to (1) develop consensus on critical domains of social cognition and (2) identify the best existing measures of social cognition for use in treatment studies.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODS: Experts in social cognition were invited to nominate key domains of social cognition and the best measures of those domains. Nominations for measures were reduced according to set criteria, and all available psychometric information about these measures was summarized and provided to RAND panelists. Panelists rated the quality of each measure on multiple criteria, and diverging ratings were discussed at the in-person meeting to obtain consensus.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: Expert surveys identified 4 core domains of social cognition-emotion processing, social perception, theory of mind/mental state attribution, and attributional style/bias. Using RAND panel consensus ratings, the following measures were selected for further evaluation: Ambiguous Intentions Hostility Questionnaire, Bell Lysaker Emotion Recognition Task, Penn Emotion Recognition Test, Relationships Across Domains, Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test, The Awareness of Social Inferences Test, Hinting Task, and Trustworthiness Task.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nDISCUSSION: While it was possible to establish consensus, only a limited amount of psychometric information is currently available for the candidate measures, which underscores the need for well-validated and standardized measures in this area.},

  abstract = {Many working equids in developing countries experience poor health and welfare due to environmental and management factors. Collecting baseline data on these populations is essential to inform education projects to improve equid health and welfare. Gili Trawangan is an island in Indonesia that has no motor vehicles and a working pony population of approximately 200. This pilot study sought to determine baseline data on their health, welfare, and husbandry to inform future health and welfare strategies. A cross-sectional study was performed in May 2017 consisting of a pony cart driver questionnaire (n = 33) and a basic pony health examination (n = 38). The body condition scores of ponies were 3/5 (60.5\%), 2/5 (31.6\%), and 1/5 (7.9\%), while 38\% and 92\% of ponies had lameness and foot pathology, respectively, and 31 ponies (86.1\%) had at least one wound. Thirty percent of cart drivers stated they would work their ponies despite evidence of injury or illness. Limited education, poor access to veterinary services, and remoteness pose barriers to improving pony health and welfare. Our results indicate a need for, and can help inform, targeted education programmes to improve the lives of working ponies and protect livelihoods and tourism on Gili Trawangan.},

  abstract = {Background: Cats are globally popular pets and pedigree cats are increasingly prevalent, with brachycephalic breeds being the most registered breeds. How owners decide upon and acquire their cats is poorly understood. Moreover, there are growing concerns about the health and welfare of brachycephalic (BC) dogs and recent studies are raising the awareness of health and welfare problems in BC cats. Methods: An online survey investigated owners\&rsquo; motivations, perceptions and behaviours prior to, during and following acquisition of non-pedigree (NP), extreme brachycephalic pedigree (BC; i.e., Persian and Exotic Shorthair) and mild to non-BC pedigree (P) cats. Results: The survey received 1367 valid responses (NP n = 882, P n = 400, BC n = 85 (6.2\%)). There were marked differences between NP, P and BC owners\&rsquo; perception of their cats\&rsquo; health and welfare, reason(s) for acquisition and its process. Owners of NP were less influenced by appearance, behaviour and other features than P or BC owners. In contrast, P and BC owners were highly influenced by appearance, with P owners also placing greater importance on good breed health than BC owners. BC owners were less likely to recommend their breeds to prospective cat owners, apparently concerned by high maintenance requirements. Conclusion: Further research is needed to determine how decision-making is constructed and how it may be improved, especially in respect of welfare outcomes for extreme BC cats given the increased weighting given to appearance over health.},

  abstract = {Stereotypic behaviours (SBs) are sometimes assumed homogeneous, despite their diverse morphologies, as if sharing a common aetiology. However, if different SB forms are instead heterogeneous, they may have different causes, potentially impacting how best to prevent or manage them. We therefore conducted two exploratory studies with mink (Neovison vison) to investigate whether ‘loco’ SBs (locomotor forms like pacing, and ‘stationary’ forms like head-bobbing) are homogeneous or heterogeneous, and to corroborate previous findings that ‘scrabbling’ (stereotypic scratching at cage walls) is distinct from loco SBs. We assessed correlations between their time-budgets (Studies 1 and 2), followed young mink as they aged (Study 2), and used chi-square goodness-of-fit tests to explore whether some SB forms co-occur within bouts more or less frequently than expected by chance (Study 2). Co-occurrence in bouts and positive correlations between different SB forms would indicate homogeneity and perhaps shared causal factors. Conversely, SB forms appearing on their own in bouts and/or showing absent or negative correlations with other forms would indicate heterogeneity. Study 1 demonstrated negative correlations between scrabbling and most loco SB forms (p {$<$} 0.05), but positive correlations between most loco forms (p {$<$} 0.05). Study 2 improved upon Study 1’s methods with a new sample of mink, a refined ethogram, and the collection of longitudinal data and data on multiform sequences during SB bouts. Scrabbling, again, negatively correlated with several loco SB forms (p {$<$} 0.05). It was also likely to occur in bouts without any other SB form. Moreover, within the loco group, the two subtypes of route-tracing (‘nestbox pacing’ and pacing) positively correlated (p {$<$} 0.05), and ‘nestbox pacing’ often occurred in bouts with pacing. Stationary SBs, however, appeared heterogeneous: head-twirling and head-bobbing tended to positively correlate with each other (p {$<$} 0.10), but not other forms, and to appear in individual bouts; while whole-body bobbing and head-weaving positively correlated with route-tracing (p {$<$} 0.10), and they also co-occurred. Overall, results confirmed that scrabbling is distinct from other SBs. Loco SBs, however, appeared either homogeneous (Study 1) or heterogeneous (Study 2), depending on the ethogram. We conclude that a SB ethogram precisely based on morphology (e.g., whole-body versus head-based SBs) is most likely to reveal underlying heterogeneities; that future researchers should validate our new proposed mink SB subcategories, ‘whole-body’ and ‘head-based’; and that our methods could usefully be applied to other species to categorise their SBs.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The worldwide prevalence estimates of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)/hyperkinetic disorder (HD) are highly heterogeneous. Presently, the reasons for this discrepancy remain poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to determine the possible causes of the varied worldwide estimates of the disorder and to compute its worldwide-pooled prevalence. METHOD: The authors searched MEDLINE and PsycINFO databases from January 1978 to December 2005 and reviewed textbooks and reference lists of the studies selected. Authors of relevant articles from North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, Oceania, and the Middle East and ADHD/HD experts were contacted. Surveys were included if they reported point prevalence of ADHD/HD for subjects 18 years of age or younger from the general population or schools according to DSM or ICD criteria. RESULTS: The literature search generated 9,105 records, and 303 full-text articles were reviewed. One hundred and two studies comprising 171,756 subjects from all world regions were included. The ADHD/HD worldwide-pooled prevalence was 5.29\%. This estimate was associated with significant variability. In the multivariate metaregression model, diagnostic criteria, source of information, requirement of impairment for diagnosis, and geographic origin of the studies were significantly associated with ADHD/HD prevalence rates. Geographic location was associated with significant variability only between estimates from North America and both Africa and the Middle East. No significant differences were found between Europe and North America. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that geographic location plays a limited role in the reasons for the large variability of ADHD/HD prevalence estimates worldwide. Instead, this variability seems to be explained primarily by the methodological characteristics of studies.},

  abstract = {Most animals must travel to find food, incurring an unavoidable energy and time cost. Economic theory predicts, and experimental work confirms, that within species, increasing the distance traveled each day to find food has negative fitness consequences, decreasing the amount of energy invested in maintenance, repair, and reproduction. Here, we show that this relationship between daily distance traveled and reproductive success is fundamentally different between species and over evolutionary time in many lineages. Phylogenetically controlled analyses of 161 eutherian mammals indicate that, after controlling for body mass, evolutionary increases in the daily distance traveled are associated with corresponding increases in both total fertility (number of offspring per lifetime) and total offspring mass (grams of offspring per lifetime). This suggests that over evolutionary time, increasing travel distance is often part of a strategy for procuring more food energy and not necessarily a response to decreased food availability. These results have important implications for ecological comparisons among species, including assessments of habitat quality based on locomotor behavior.},

  abstract = {Nose contact is a frequent form of social behaviour in pigs, but the motivational reasons underlying this behaviour remain unclear. We investigated the frequency, direction and type of sow\&ndash;piglet nosing behaviour and its association with sow and piglet traits. Social nosing behaviour was recorded by live observations and video recordings in 22 sows and their 249 piglets in free-farrowing pens once weekly during the first three weeks after farrowing (3 times 30 min of observations per litter). Piglet-to-sow nosing occurred on average 32.8 \&plusmn; 2.35 times per 30 min per litter. Heavier piglets at one week of age nosed the sow more than lighter piglets (p = 0.01). Piglet-to-sow nosing was unrelated to the piglet\&rsquo;s sex or teat order. Sow-to-piglet nosing occurred on average 3.6 \&plusmn; 0.53 times per 30 min, and this was unrelated to litter size. Primiparous sows nosed their piglets more in the second week after farrowing. Litters in which piglet-to-sow nosing occurred more showed less variation in the expression of this behaviour across the weeks. Social nosing between sow and piglets deserves further research to understand the positive implications of this behaviour for sow and piglet welfare.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} The analysis utilized data on performance traits recorded between 1993 and 2004 on 3- and 4-year-old Hungarian Sporthorse mares. Traits were categorized in three groups, chosen to describe conformation, free jumping and movement. Low to moderate correlations were found among traits within each of those groups. There were high correlations between type and frame for both ages; and within free jumping performance traits, jumping style and jumping ability were highly correlated as well. In principal component analyses of test results for 3- and 4-year-old mares, 9 factors (ratio of variance = 80.935) and 7 factors (ratio of variance = 74.115) were identified, respectively. Dendograms based upon cluster analysis verified the separation of trait groups. The trait of "impulsion in elasticity of movement" could be assigned to movement traits in 3-year-old; but as a probable consequence of training, it could be assigned to conformation traits, especially to overall impression, when horses were 4-year-old.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {A study was conducted over 24 days to evaluate the effects of three environmental enrichment techniques (fozen balls of ice containing fish, various scents, hanging logs) on four captive African lions (Panthera lee). Behavioural data on activity level and behavioural diversity were collected daily during a baseline and an enriched session. All enrichments produced positive changes in behaviour. Enrichment was also associated with increased use of space by the lions. The enrichment techniques evaluated in this study each produced distinct and positive changes in behaviour thus reinforcing the need for variety to be exercised in captive enrichment programmes. Providing different enrichments allows animals to perform a greater range of behaviours, become more active in captivity, and will decrease the likelihood of habituation to certain enrichment items. Environmental enrichment should be a part of any management protocol for animal welfare and health.},

Speciation relies on cycling through these three steps and each may limit the rate at which new species form. We estimate phylogenetic relationships among all Himalayan songbirds to ask whether the development of reproductive isolation and ecological competition, both factors that limit range expansions, set an ultimate limit on speciation. Based on a phylogeny for all 358 species distributed along the eastern elevational gradient, here we show that body size and shape differences evolved early in the radiation, with the elevational band occupied by a species evolving later. These results are consistent with competition for niche space limiting species accumulation. Even the elevation dimension seems to be approaching ecological saturation, because the closest relatives both inside the assemblage and elsewhere in the Himalayas are on average separated by more than five million years, which is longer than it generally takes for reproductive isolation to be completed; also, elevational distributions are well explained by resource availability, notably the abundance of arthropods, and not by differences in diversification rates in different elevational zones. Our results imply that speciation rate is ultimately set by niche filling (that is, ecological competition for resources), rather than by the rate of acquisition of reproductive isolation.},

It is argued that the need is urgent and the time is right, and that various circumstances and opportunities are now favourable. The prospect is for the Arabian Peninsula to maintain its roles as home to specialised species, to continue to act as a sanctuary and crossroads for species from three major neighbouring biological realms, and to be a potential refuge in the face of climate change.},

  abstract = {About the report The World Alzheimer Report 2016 reviews research evidence on the elements of healthcare for people living with dementia and suggests how it should be improved and made more efficient. People living with dementia have poor access to appropriate healthcare, even in most high income country settings, where only around 50\% of people living with dementia receive a diagnosis. In low and middle income countries, less than 10\% of cases are diagnosed. As populations age, due to increasing life expectancy, the number of people with dementia is increasing. We estimate that there were 46.8 million people worldwide living with dementia in 2015 and this number will reach 131.5 million in 2050. It is unlikely that the usual specialist-led approach to dementia care can expand fast enough to keep up with increases in need, and even more unlikely that healthcare coverage can be improved without rebalancing to give primary care a more prominent role.},

This paper describes two linked studies measuring rate of removal of carcasses from farmland in the UK, carried out to inform the results of a pesticide study involving carcass searching. In winter, 6\% of carcasses had been removed 24 h after placement, and 32\% had been removed 96 h after placement; wild bird carcasses were removed significantly faster than those of artificially reared birds. In summer, 76\% of carcasses had been removed 24 h after placement and 91\% after 96 h. A literature review of similar studies is given. Carcass removal rates by predators and scavengers appear to vary widely between sites and seasons, and may be high. If the results of studies involving carcass searches or surveillance are to be interpreted correctly, carcass removal rate by scavengers should be measured under similar conditions to, and contemporaneous with, those under which mortality is expected to occur.},

  abstract = {The strengthening of the bond between humans and animals has changed the landscape of the veterinary profession. This has, in turn, led the legal system to assess damages in veterinary malpractice and liability cases more carefully, paying attention to the possibility of using clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) to prove whether the defendant veterinarian contravened or not the standard of care. In this era of evidence-based veterinary medicine, CPGs are becoming an integral part of many aspects of veterinary practice, even if CPGs do not have the force of law and are situated halfway between ethical rules and legal requirements. Although guidelines have been used for several years, there seems to be a general lack of recognition of the medical and legal ramifications of CPGs for veterinarians. This creates ambiguity and inconsistency in the care that veterinary practitioners provide, compromises the care animals receive, and prevents the courts from assessing veterinarian competence in a systematic and rational way. On the basis of these considerations, this article discusses the legal implications of CPGs in veterinary medicine for dogs and cats and explores how the law may treat CPGs in the future. Redefining the CPGs should be a priority for veterinary profession. NOTE: The authors chose to use the terms \&ldquo;companion animal,\&rdquo; \&ldquo;pet,\&rdquo; and \&ldquo;small animal\&rdquo; interchangeably throughout this article, as all three are commonly in use and refer to the same animals (dogs and cats).},

  abstract = {{$<$}h3{$>$}ABSTRACT{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Many popular disease transmission models have helped nations respond to the COVID-19 pandemic by informing decisions about pandemic planning, resource allocation, implementation of social distancing measures and other non-pharmaceutical interventions. We study how five epidemiological models forecast and assess the course of the pandemic in India: a baseline model, an extended SIR (eSIR) model, two extended SEIR (SAPHIRE and SEIR-\emph{fansy}) models, and a semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model (ICM). Using COVID-19 data for India from March 15 to June 18 to train the models, we generate predictions from each of the five models from June 19 to July 18. To compare prediction accuracy with respect to reported cumulative and active case counts and cumulative death counts, we compute the symmetric mean absolute prediction error (SMAPE) for each of the five models. For active case counts, SMAPE values are 0.72 (SEIR-fansy) and 33.83 (eSIR). For cumulative case counts, SMAPE values are 1.76 (baseline) 23.10 (eSIR), 2.07 (SAPHIRE) and 3.20 (SEIR-\emph{fansy}). For cumulative death counts, the SMAPE values are 7.13 (SEIR-\emph{fansy}) and 26.30 (eSIR). For cumulative cases and deaths, we compute Pearson’s and Lin’s correlation coefficients to investigate how well the projected and observed reported COVID-counts agree. Three models (SAPHIRE, SEIR-\emph{fansy} and ICM) return total (sum of reported and unreported) counts as well. We compute underreporting factors as of June 30 and note that the SEIR-\emph{fansy} model reports the highest underreporting factor for active cases (6.10) and cumulative deaths (3.62), while the SAPHIRE model reports the highest underreporting factor for cumulative cases (27.79).{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Using complete phylogenies of contemporary carnivores and primates, we present, to our knowledge, the first comparative test showing that high trophic level, low population density slow life history and, in particular, small geographical range size are all significantly and independently associated with a high extinction risk in declining species. These traits together explain nearly 50\% of the total between-species variation in extinction risk. Much of the remaining variation can be accounted for by external anthropogenic factors that affect species irrespective of their biology.},

Available impact studies of insect-resistant and herbicide-tolerant crops show that these technologies are beneficial to farmers and consumers, producing large aggregate welfare gains as well as positive effects for the environment and human health. The advantages of future applications could even be much bigger. Given a conducive institutional framework, GM crops can contribute significantly to global food security and poverty reduction. Nonetheless, widespread public reservations have led to a complex system of regulations. Overregulation has become a real threat for the further development and use of GM crops. The costs in terms of foregone benefits may be large, especially for developing countries. Economics research has an important role to play in designing efficient regulatory mechanisms and agricultural innovation systems.},

  abstract = {Documenting the effects of novel forms of enrichment is becoming increasingly important within the field of environmental enrichment. Appropriate documentation and evaluation must accompany any enrichment research project in order for accurate results to be obtained. The objective of the present study was to provide an example of how the level of effort in documenting the effect of enrichment is linked to how it is evaluated. This study was carried out on eight cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) at Fota Wildlife Park, Ireland. Temporal feeding variation was the enrichment type used during this study. Behavior data were collected in five different ways in order to simulate varying degrees of effort. Randomization tests were utilized to analyze behavior data. Significant behavioral differences were observed in the first four sampling methods with patterns of behavior remaining similar in all five methods. However, only the most time intensive method concurred with findings previously published utilizing this form of enrichment. No significant differences in behavior were detected when the least time intensive method was used. Between 1 and 2 hr of data collection daily is necessary to evaluate temporal feeding variation accurately. However, 30-45 min of data collection also gave an insight into the effectiveness of the enrichment. Methods of evaluation can influence the interpretations of the strength of the enriching effect of the treatment. Appropriate evaluation and accurate reporting of enrichment is crucial for the future development of the environmental enrichment field.},

The typical retrieval-practice effects are considerably enhanced memory for practiced items accompanied by low levels of recall, relative to baseline, for previously studied items that are associated with the practiced items but were not themselves practiced. The two experiments demonstrated that the former effect persisted over 12 hr; the latter effect also persisted over 12 hr, but only if a period of nocturnal sleep occurred during the retention interval. We propose that consolidation processes occurring during sleep, and possibly featuring some form of off-line rehearsal, mediate these long-term effects of retrieval practice.},

  abstract = {Temperament describes the idea that individual behavioural differences are repeatable over time and across situations. This common phenomenon covers numerous traits, such as aggressiveness, avoidance of novelty, willingness to take risks, exploration, and sociality. The study of temperament is central to animal psychology, behavioural genetics, pharmacology, and animal husbandry, but relatively few studies have examined the ecology and evolution of temperament traits. This situation is surprising, given that temperament is likely to exert an important influence on many aspects of animal ecology and evolution, and that individual variation in temperament appears to be pervasive amongst animal species. Possible explanations for this neglect of temperament include a perceived irrelevance, an insufficient understanding of the link between temperament traits and fitness, and a lack of coherence in terminology with similar traits often given different names, or different traits given the same name. We propose that temperament can and should be studied within an evolutionary ecology framework and provide a terminology that could be used as a working tool for ecological studies of temperament. Our terminology includes five major temperament trait categories: shyness-boldness, exploration-avoidance, activity, sociability and aggressiveness. This terminology does not make inferences regarding underlying dispositions or psychological processes, which may have restrained ecologists and evolutionary biologists from working on these traits. We present extensive literature reviews that demonstrate that temperament traits are heritable, and linked to fitness and to several other traits of importance to ecology and evolution. Furthermore, we describe ecologically relevant measurement methods and point to several ecological and evolutionary topics that would benefit from considering temperament, such as phenotypic plasticity, conservation biology, population sampling, and invasion biology.},

  abstract = {Context: Despite the importance of timely diagnosis and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) among adolescent females, considering the paucity of data focusing on this group and controversies documented on its recognition and management, the purpose of this review was to summarize challenges and recommendations of diagnosis and treatment for adolescents with PCOS. Evidence Acquisition: This review summarizes papers documented on PCOS among adolescent females. PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases were searched for retrieving studies conducted on PCOS among adolescent females up to March, 2019. The final selection of papers was made based on their relevancy with the fields of diagnosis and treatment of PCOS in this age group. Results: Oligo-anovulation in adolescents, if persistent, is a matter for concern. Hirsutism and moderate to severe acne in adolescent females should be considered as clinical manifestations of hyperandrogenism (HA). Diagnosis of biochemical HA in adolescents with PCOS requires reliable tests using well-defined normal ranges. In adolescent females, an elevated androgen level (hyperandrogenemia) alone is not enough to detect HA, unless it is persistent and associated with anovulation. Metabolic disorders should not be used as diagnostic criteria of PCOS among adolescent females. Re-assessment of all adolescent females with probable PCOS, using reliable diagnostic criteria, is needed to avoid over diagnosis and unnecessary treatment in healthy normal females without HA. In adolescent females with PCOS, the main clinical problem is the control of menstrual irregularity and hirsutism; treatment approaches for these patients are primarily directed at the major clinical manifestations and complaints. Lifestyle modifications are baseline interventions, which can be added to special treatments, such as Oral Contraceptives (OCs), metformin, or antiandrogens for most adolescents with PCOS, particularly those with overweight or obesity. Conclusions: This review emphasizes the use of standard diagnostic criteria for PCOS, developed for adolescents. Although early recognition and management of PCOS in adolescents can prevent long-term complications associated with this syndrome, clinicians should re-evaluate all such patients with features very similar to PCOS to avoid over/incorrect diagnosis using precise criteria, suggested for this age group.},

But the shrinking of habitat and \textbackslash nthe selective killing off of tuskers in key populations by ivory poachers are \textbackslash ncause for grave concern.  \textbackslash nElephants in captivity are close to our hearts but there are times standards \textbackslash nfall short of the humane treatment and welfare they are surely entitled to. \textbackslash nTheir care givers, Mahouts and veterinary doctors too need recognition \textbackslash nand better amenities.  \textbackslash nProject Elephant has, since 1992, done much commendable work. But its \textbackslash nsuccesses notwithstanding, it needs more than an accretion of resources.  \textbackslash nElephant habitats are under immense pressure. Rapid economic expansion and development pressures require far more attention to land use plans from an ecological perspective. New knowledge needs to be brought to \textbackslash nbear in population and habitat assessment.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nAbove all, systems of mitigation to alleviate human-elephant conflict need \textbackslash nto re-energise and be made much more accountable.  \textbackslash nTo accomplish this requires administrative overhaul and better machinery. \textbackslash nThe Task Force strongly favours new institutions and mechanisms to \textbackslash nachieve these wider objectives. \textbackslash nWe need a new National Elephant Conservation Authority (NECA) on \textbackslash nthe lines of the structure for tiger conservation. Nestled with it will be a \textbackslash nnew Consortium of Elephant Research and Estimation (CERE) who will \textbackslash ndevelop and apply the best methods for enumeration. Transparency of \textbackslash nmethods and results will uphold standards and inculcate a scientific \textbackslash ntemper. \textbackslash nAlong with similar changes at the state level, there will be a new category \textbackslash nof Elephant Landscapes. These, ten in number will include the existing \textbackslash nand proposed 32 Elephant Reserves.  \textbackslash nWhile no new reserves are proposed, there will be a consolidation of the \textbackslash nexisting reserves. Over 40 per cent of the Elephant Reserves is not under \textbackslash nProtected Area or government forest.  \textbackslash nThe Task Force favours Ecologically Sensitive Area status under the \textbackslash nEnvironment Protection Act to regulate activity that may be ecologically \textbackslash nnegative.  \textbackslash nElephant Corridors that link critical populations had already been \textbackslash nidentified prior to the Task Force by scientists, administrators and reputed \textbackslash nvoluntary organizations. We have now ranked the Elephant Corridors \textbackslash naccording to priority and feasibility for action.  Our main emphasis is on \textbackslash ninnovative methods to secure habitats beyond the Protected Areas. These \textbackslash ncould include Community or Conservation Reserves, Ecosystem Services \textbackslash npayments and conservation easements. Protected Area expansion can also \textbackslash nbe considered but so too can other measures. These will forge partnerships \textbackslash nand reinforce alliances for conservation at ground level.  \textbackslash nIt is vital to stress that elephant conservation is about combining quality \textbackslash nscience with humane administration.

We developed a camera enhanced digital signage display that acquires audience measurement metrices with computer vision algorithms. Temporal metrices of person’s dwell time, display in-view time, and attention time are extracted. The system also determines demographic metrices of gender and age group. The digital signage display was deployed in a real world environment of a clothing boutique, where demographic and viewership data of 1294 persons ensemble was recorded, manually verified and analysed. Analysis shows that 35\% of ensemble specifically looked-at the display, having the average attention time of 0.7s. Interestingly, the attention time was substantially higher for men (1.2s) as for women (0.4s). Age group comparison reveals that youth (1-14 years) are the most responsive to the digital signage. Finally, the analysis shows that the average attention time is significantly higher when displaying the dynamic content (0.9s) as compared to the static content (0.6s).},

  abstract = {Reintroduction attempts have faced low, albeit improving, success rates, especially for threatened and endangered species reintroduced from captivity to the wild. This is not only a concern for conservation, as the low success of reintroduction also implies an animal welfare issue for the individuals concerned. Success rates are particularly low for species that live in complex social structures, require greater training during development, and exhibit higher levels of intelligence. Aside from mitigating the original cause of a species extirpation from an area, behavior factors arguably represent the most important aspect influencing an animal's survival following reintroduction. Indeed, we previously recommended using behavioral indicators for determining relative reintroduction success, especially as practitioners develop and compare protocols or if survivorship is difficult to gauge. Strategic enrichment programs targeted toward developing specific skills important for survival in the wild promise to improve reintroduction success by providing individuals with opportunities to develop and improve behavioral skills, such as avoiding predation, foraging (especially for predators and primates), interacting in social groups, courtship and mating, habitat selection, and learning movement and migration routes. Enrichment also improves the physical condition of most individuals, which should also increase reintroduction success. Last but not least, such programs offer the prospect of improved animal welfare both pre- and post-release. We explore how behavioral enrichment has influenced reintroduction success and welfare in a variety of different species.},

  abstract = {Aim Effective conservation of the endangered tiger depends upon reliable knowledge of factors driving genetic differentiation and population connectivity. Connectivity models frequently use resistance surfaces not optimized with actual movement or genetic data which limits reliability. Our aim is to use empirical data on genetic diversity of tiger populations to optimize landscape resistance to gene flow and identify factors that predict local population abundance across Central India. Location The study area covers 697,000~km2 across Madhya Pradesh and parts of Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Maharashtra. Methods We used genetic data of 309 tigers and restricted multivariate optimization of correlation between landscape variables and genetic distance in a reciprocal causal modelling framework to parameterize a resistance surface for gene flow. We further evaluated the association between effective population size and landscape connectivity using all-subsets logistic regression with model averaging based on AICc. Results Gene flow is primarily related to topographic roughness and slope position and secondarily to human footprint and land cover. It is much higher in areas of rough topography and ridge tops and is facilitated by forest cover in areas with low human footprint. In contrast, effective population size in protected areas is primarily driven by extent of protected areas and surrounding forest cover, and is not significantly related to resistant kernel connectivity value. Main Conclusions This is the first study to use a rigorous multivariate optimization approach to identify factors which limit gene flow of tigers. Tiger movement is highly affected by landscape features, and dispersing tigers move through rough terrain along forested ridges, avoiding non-forest areas with high human footprint, while local tiger population density is driven primarily by the extent of protected forested habitat. These results have important implications for tiger conservation and can be used to develop empirically supported prioritization of core areas and corridors.},

  abstract = {The anthropogenic food subsidy in the diet of animal populations is known to have negative ecological and physiological impacts on wildlife. The red fox (Vulpes vulpes), a generalist species living close to human habitation, often has access to garbage dumps. We studied the dietary pattern of red fox in the cold desert of the Trans-Himalayas in India, where natural resources are limited. We analysed a total of 1264 scats across six representative sites and examined red fox occurrences as a response to the availability of anthropogenic subsidies. We found that human subsidies contribute substantially (maximum 55.87\%) to red fox diet. Red fox occurrence significantly increased with the increase in consumption of the food items originating from human subsidies (R2= 0.85, p =.008). Red foxes consumed less wild prey (rodents and lagomorphs) where there was an abundant supply of human subsidies. We found that dog presence negatively affected the consumption of human subsidies by the foxes. We posit that local cultures and religious practices might have played an indirect role in determining the red fox diet and occurrence. Our study recommends that management of anthropogenic subsidies is crucial to keep the wild populations healthy.},

These features include heavy-tail flight and pause-time distributions and the super-diffusive nature of mobility. Human walks are not random walks, but it is surprising that the patterns of human walks and Levy walks contain some statistical similarity. Our study is based on 226 daily GPS traces collected from 101 volunteers in five different outdoor sites. The heavy-tail flight distribution of human mobility induces the super-diffusivity of travel, but up to 30 min to 1 h due to the boundary effect of people's daily movement, which is caused by the tendency of people to move within a predefined (also confined) area of daily activities. These tendencies are not captured in common mobility models such as random way point (RWP). To evaluate the impact of these tendencies on the performance of mobile networks, we construct a simple truncated Levy walk mobility (TLW) model that emulates the statistical features observed in our analysis and under which we measure the performance of routing protocols in delay-tolerant networks (DTNs) and mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). The results indicate the following. Higher diffusivity induces shorter intercontact times in DTN and shorter path durations with higher success probability in MANET. The diffusivity of TLW is in between those of RWP and Brownian motion (BM). Therefore, the routing performance under RWP as commonly used in mobile network studies and tends to be overestimated for DTNs and underestimated for MANETs compared to the performance under TLW.},

Results from fixed effects analysis of panel data on 87 universities for the period 1986–87 to 1995–96 indicate that year‐to‐year changes in athletic success have a positive impact on levels of alumni giving, but that other types of donors are not as responsive. Also, long‐standing athletic traditions established prior to the sample period appear to generate academic benefits in the form of increased charitable donations from all sources. However, the estimated impact of a successful athletic tradition is relatively weak when compared to the effect of student and faculty quality on educational contributions.},

This kind of memory is considered to be dependent upon the hippocampal system. However, our emotional state seems to considerably affect the way in which we retain information and the accuracy with which the retention occurs. The amygdala is the most notably involved brain structure in emotional responses and the formation of emotional memories. In this review we describe a system, composed of the amygdala and the hippocampus, that acts synergistically to form long-term memories of significantly emotional events. These brain structures are activated following an emotional event and cross-talk with each other in the process of consolidation. This dual activation of the amygdala and the hippocampus and the dynamics between them may be what gives emotionally based memories their uniqueness.},

Behavioural data (exploration, stereotypies, social interactions, activity/inactivity rates) were collected on four male wolves during four two-week long phases: initial control, hidden food, novel object, final control. Three observation sessions were performed daily: before, during and after feeding. Number of visitors and their permanence in front of the exhibit were recorded. After watching the wolves, visitors were asked to fill out a brief questionnaire in order to investigate their perception of captive wolf welfare, as well as their attitude towards wolf conservation issues. Despite the high inter-individual variability in their behavioural response, all wolves seemed to benefit from feeding enrichment. With regard to visitors, interest in the exhibit increased when enrichment was provided. Visitors\&rsquo; perception of the level of welfare of wolves improved if they attended a feeding session, especially during the novel object phase. Visitors\&rsquo; attitude towards wolf conservation issues also improved during feeding sessions, regardless of enrichment provision.},

Blood and fecal samples were collected from a group of 71 dogs at the time of admission to the shelter. In 46 of these dogs, sampling was repeated after four weeks. Well-recognized welfare biomarkers, such as fecal cortisol and leukocytes, as well as some innovative parameters (\&beta;-endorphin and lysozyme) were determined. Uni- and multivariate statistical analyses were used to evaluate their interactions and changes over time. Neutrophils (p \&lt; 0.01), lysozyme (p \&lt; 0.05), and fecal cortisol (p \&lt; 0.05) decreased, while lymphocytes (p \&lt; 0.05) increased after four weeks compared to the first days of being in the shelter, suggesting an improvement in the dogs\&rsquo; welfare over time. A principal component analysis extracted three bipolar components (PCs), explaining 75\% of the variance and indicating negative associations between neutrophil and lymphocyte (PC1), lysozyme and \&beta;-endorphin (PC2), cortisol and lysozyme (PC3). The associations between these variables within each PC also confirmed the intricate relationships between the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the immune system as well as the importance of a multiparametric approach in evaluating welfare.},

We propose a computational model of aversion that combines goal-directed and Pavlovian forms of control into a unifying framework in which their relative importance is regulated by factors such as threat distance and controllability. Using simulations, we test whether the model can reproduce available empirical findings and discuss its relevance to understanding factors underlying negative emotions such as fear and anxiety. Furthermore, the specific method used to construct the model permits a natural mapping from its components to brain structure and function. Our model provides a basis for a unifying account of aversion that can guide empirical and interventional study contexts.},

  abstract = {Due to its distinct properties, wild boar meat is considered a highly desirable consumer product, in a market that is expanding. Outdoor production is also favoured by consumers who value animal welfare and environmental sustainability when choosing meat products. There is evidence that farms that include pasture for grazing typically have reduced feeding costs. Such production systems can also be more environmentally sustainable as the input (pasture) is inedible to humans, compared to conventional indoor systems, which use human-edible feeds (e.g., soya). However, some wild boar farms have performed poorly compared to those rearing other swine such as hybrid wild boar and domestic pigs. Diet is central to all livestock production and is likely a significant influencing factor of wild boar performance, both in terms of forage consumption and nutritional composition. Other factors may also influence performance, such as weather, behaviour and grazing management. Wild boar production systems hold their own intrinsic value in a growing marketplace. However, information gathered through the study of wild boar has external applications in informing outdoor domestic pig production systems to encourage the use of pasture as part of the habitat of domestic pigs.},

Overall, there was a medium to strong sample-weighted average correlation between descriptive norms and intentions (r+ = .44). Regression analysis showed that descriptive norms increased the variance explained in intention by 5 percent after attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioural control had been taken into account. Moderator analyses indicated that younger samples and health risk behaviours were both associated with stronger correlations between descriptive norms and intentions. Implications of the findings for the conceptualization of social influences in the TPB are discussed.},

From 152 longitudinal studies, 3,217 test–retest correlation coefficients were compiled. Meta-analytic estimates of mean population test–retest correlation coefficients showed that trait consistency increased from .31 in childhood to .54 during the college years, to .64 at age 30, and then reached a plateau around .74 between ages 50 and 70 when time interval was held constant at 6.7 years. Analysis of moderators of consistency showed that the longitudinal time interval had a negative relation to trait consistency and that temperament dimensions were less consistent than adult personality traits.

  abstract = {Two experiments (modeled after J. Deese's 1959 study) revealed remarkable levels of false recall and false recognition in a list learning paradigm. In Experiment 1, subjects studied lists of 12 words (e.g., bed, rest, awake); each list was composed of associates of 1 nonpresented word (e.g., sleep). On immediate free recall tests, the nonpresented associates were recalled 40\% of the time and were later recognized with high confidence. In Experiment 2, a false recall rate of 55\% was obtained with an expanded set of lists, and on a later recognition test, subjects produced false alarms to these items at a rate comparable to the hit rate. The act of recall enhanced later remembering of both studied and nonstudied material. The results reveal a powerful illusion of memory: People remember events that never happened. False memories—either remembering events that never happened, or remembering them quite differently from the way they happened—have recently captured the attention of both psychologists and the public at large. The primary impetus for this recent surge of interest is the increase in the number of cases in which memories of previously unrecognized abuse are reported during the course of therapy. Some researchers have argued that certain therapeutic practices can cause the creation of false memories, and therefore, the apparent "recovery" of memories during the course of therapy may actually represent the creation of memories (Lindsay \& Read, 1994; Loftus, 1993). Although the concept of false memories is currently enjoying an increase in publicity, it is not new; psychologists have been studying false memories in several laboratory paradigms for years. Schacter (in press) provides an historical overview of the study of memory distortions. Bartlett (1932) is usually credited with conducting the first experimental investigation of false memories; he had subjects read an Indian folktale, "The War of the Ghosts," and recall it repeatedly. Although he reported no aggregate data, but only sample protocols, his results seemed to show distortions in subjects' memories over repeated attempts to recall the story. Interestingly, Bartlett's repeated reproduction results never have been successfully replicated by later researchers (see Gauld \& Stephenson, 1967; Roediger, Wheeler, \& Rajaram, 1993); indeed, Wheeler and Roediger (1992) showed that recall of prose passages (including "The War of the Ghosts") This research was supported by Grant F49620-92-J-0437 from the Air Force Office of Scientific Research. We thank Ron Haas and Lubna Manal for aid in conducting this research. Also, we thank Endel Tulving for bringing the Deese (1959) report to our attention. The manuscript benefited from comments},

  abstract = {Cognitive control includes the ability to formulate goals and plans of action and to follow these while facing distraction. Previous neuroimaging studies have shown that the presence of conflicting response alternatives in Stroop-like tasks increases activity in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), suggesting that the ACC is involved in cognitive control. However, the exact nature of ACC function is still under debate. The prevailing conflict detection hypothesis maintains that the ACC is involved in performance monitoring. According to this view, ACC activity reflects the detection of response conflict and acts as a signal that engages regulative processes subserved by lateral prefrontal brain regions. Here, we provide evidence from functional MRI that challenges this view and favors an alternative view, according to which the ACC has a role in regulation itself. Using an arrow-word Stroop task, subjects responded to incongruent, congruent, and neutral stimuli. A critical prediction made by the conflict detection hypothesis is that ACC activity should be increased only when conflicting response alternatives are present. Our data show that ACC responses are larger for neutral than for congruent stimuli, in the absence of response conflict. This result demonstrates the engagement of the ACC in regulation itself. A computational model of Stroop-like performance instantiating a version of the regulative hypothesis is shown to account for our findings.},

  abstract = {Studies of the cognitive abilities of pigs are increasing in number, due to their relevance for the fields of animal welfare and biomedical research. While both female and male pigs have been used in cognitive tasks, possible sex differences in performance have not yet received extensive attention. This is of interest, as sexual dimorphism in cognitive abilities has been documented for a variety of species. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of sex on pigs’ performance in two cognitive tasks. Spatial learning and memory of ten female and ten male pigs was compared in a spatial holeboard task. Working and reference memory, as well as measures of motivation and exploration were assessed. Both females and males acquired the task and no differences were found between sexes for any measures of spatial memory. However, female pigs performed more successfully during reversal trials (shorter latency to first reward, higher number of rewards found), indicating greater response flexibility. This difference between sexes was transient, with males eventually reaching the same level of performance as the females. Judgment bias, a cognitive measure of affective state, was subsequently assessed using an active choice judgment bias task. Pigs were trained to respond differently to a negative and a positive stimulus, signaling either a small or a large reward. During judgment bias testing, pigs were presented with ambiguous cues and their trained ‘positive’ and ‘negative’ responses were recorded as optimistic or pessimistic choices, respectively. Both females and males displayed a slightly optimistic judgment bias. Optimistic choosing decreased with repeated testing for both groups. It is likely the pigs learned about the unrewarded outcome of ambiguous cues, rendering them no longer ambiguous. Further improvement of the judgment bias task as a cognitive measure of affective state is deemed necessary. Overall, our results indicate that sex is not a confounding factor when measuring baseline performance of pigs in the spatial holeboard or judgment bias task. Sex effects were only found when subjecting the pigs to a reversal task, warranting further study of sex differences in response flexibility. Such a difference would have implications for pig welfare, as it suggests that males are slower to cope with changes in their environment.},

  abstract = {Women suffer more often from depression than males, indicating that hormones might be involved in the etiology of this disease. Low as well as high testosterone (T) levels are related to depression and well-being in women, T plasma levels correlate to depression in a parabolic curve: at about 0.4–0.6 ng/ml plasma free T a minimum of depression is detected. Lower levels are related to depression, osteoporosis, declining libido, dyspareunia and an increase in total body fat mass. Androgen levels in women decrease continuously to about 50\% before menopause compared to a 20-year-old women. Androgen levels even decline 70\% within 24 h when women undergo surgical removal of the ovaries. Conventional oral contraception or HRT cause a decline in androgens because of higher levels of SHBG. Hyperandrogenic states exist, like hirsutism, acne and polycystic ovary syndrome. Social research suggests high androgen levels cause aggressive behavior in men and women and as a consequence may cause depression. Higher androgen values are more pronounced at young ages and before and after delivery of a baby and might be responsible for the “baby blues”. It was found that depression in pubertal girls correlated best with an increase in T levels in contrast to the common belief that “environmental factors” during the time of growing up might be responsible for emotional “up and downs”. T replacement therapy might be useful in perimenopausal women suffering from hip obesity, also named gynoid obesity. Abdominal obesity in men and women is linked to type 2 diabetes and coronary heart diseases. Testosterone replacement therapy in hypoandrogenic postmenopausal women might not only protect against obesity but also reduce the risk of developing these diseases. Antiandrogenic progestins might be useful for women suffering from hyperandrogenic state in peri- and postmenopause. Individual dosing schemes balancing side effects and beneficial effects are absolutely necessary. Substantial interindividual variability in T plasma values exists, making it difficult to utilize them for diagnostic purposes. Therefore a “four-level-hormone classification scheme” was developed identifying when estradiol (E) and T levels are out of balance. (1) Low E–low T levels are correlated with osteoporosis, depression, and obesity; (2) high E–low T with obesity, decreased libido; (3) high T–low E levels with aggression, depression, increased libido, and substance abuse; (4) high E–high T with type II diabetes risk, breast cancer and cardiovascular risk. Testosterone delivery systems are needed where beneficial and negative effects can be balanced. Any woman diagnosed for osteoporosis should be questioned for symptoms of depression.},

  abstract = {Recent evidence suggests that enduring social bonds have fitness benefits. However, very little is known about the neural circuitry and neurochemistry underlying the formation and maintenance of stable social bonds outside reproductive contexts. Oxytocin (OT), a neuropeptide synthetized by the hypothalamus in mammals, regulates many complex forms of social behavior and cognition in both human and nonhuman animals. Animal research, however, has concentrated on monogamous mammals, and it remains unknown whether OT also modulates social bonds in nonreproductive contexts. In this study we provide behavioral evidence that exogenous OT promotes positive social behaviors in the domestic dog toward not only conspecifics but also human partners. Specifically, when sprayed with OT, dogs showed higher social orientation and affiliation toward their owners and higher affiliation and approach behaviors toward dog partners than when sprayed with placebo. Additionally, the exchange of socio-positive behaviors with dog partners triggered the release of endogenous OT, highlighting the involvement of OT in the development of social relationships in the domestic dog. These data provide new insight into the mechanisms that facilitate the maintenance of close social bonds beyond immediate reproductive interest or genetic ties and complement a growing body of evidence that identifies OT as one of the neurochemical foundations of sociality in mammalian species.},

  abstract = {Allostasis, the concept of maintaining stability through change, has been proposed as a term and a model to replace the ambiguous term of stress, the concept of adequately or inadequately coping with threatening or unpredictable environmental stimuli. However, both the term allostasis and its underlying model have generated criticism. Here we propose the Reactive Scope Model, an alternate graphical model that builds on the strengths of allostasis and traditional concepts of stress yet addresses many of the criticisms. The basic model proposes divergent effects in four ranges for the concentrations or levels of various physiological mediators involved in responding to stress. (1) Predictive Homeostasis is the range encompassing circadian and seasonal variation - the concentrations/levels needed to respond to predictable environmental changes. (2) Reactive Homeostasis is the range of the mediator needed to respond to unpredictable or threatening environmental changes. Together, Predictive and Reactive Homeostasis comprise the normal reactive scope of the mediator for that individual. Concentrations/levels above the Reactive Homeostasis range is (3) Homeostatic Overload, and concentrations/levels below the Predictive Homeostasis range is (4) Homeostatic Failure. These two ranges represent concentrations/levels with pathological effects and are not compatible with long-term (Homeostatic Overload) or short-term (Homeostatic Failure) health. Wear and tear is the concept that there is a cost to maintaining physiological systems in the Reactive Homeostasis range, so that over time these systems gradually lose their ability to counteract threatening and unpredictable stimuli. Wear and tear can be modeled by a decrease in the threshold between Reactive Homeostasis and Homeostatic Overload, i.e. a decrease in reactive scope. This basic model can then be modified by altering the threshold between Reactive Homeostasis and Homeostatic Overload to help understand how an individual's response to environmental stressors can differ depending upon factors such as prior stressors, dominance status, and early life experience. We illustrate the benefits of the Reactive Scope Model and contrast it with the traditional model and with allostasis in the context of chronic malnutrition, changes in social status, and changes in stress responses due to early life experiences. The Reactive Scope Model, as an extension of allostasis, should be useful to both biomedical researchers studying laboratory animals and humans, as well as ecologists studying stress in free-living animals. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

While there is little question that these spaces provide far less opportunity for natural ranging behavior and travel, less is known about the degree to which captive animals travel within their environments and what factors influence these travel patterns. We intensively studied the movement of zoo-housed chimpanzees and gorillas using a computer map interface and determined their mean daily travel and found they travelled similar distances each day when restricted to their indoor areas, but when provided addi-tional outdoor space, chimpanzees tended to increase their travel to a greater extent than did gorillas. Both species travelled shorter distances than has been recorded for their wild counterparts, however, when given access to their full indoor–outdoor exhibit; those differences were not as substantive. These findings suggest that while large, com-plex naturalistic environments might not stimulate com-parable species-typical travel patterns in captive apes, larger spaces that include outdoor areas may be better at replicating this behavioral pattern than smaller, indoor areas.},

A related bias was shown to exist in the observers' social inferences. Thus, raters estimated particular responses to be relatively common and relatively unrevealing concerning the actors' distinguishing personal dispositions when the responses in question were similar to the raters' own responses; responses differing from those of the rater, by contrast, were perceived to be relatively uncommon and revealing of the actor. These results were obtained both in questionnaire studies presenting subjects with hypothetical situations and choices and in authentic conflict situations. The implications of these findings for our understanding of social perception phenomena and for our analysis of the divergent perceptions of actors and observers are discussed. Finally, cognitive and perceptual mechanisms are proposed which might account for distortions in perceived consensus and for corresponding biases in social inference and attributional processes. © 1977.},

  abstract = {Empirical measures of animal behavior and space use within the captive environment can provide critical information about animals' requirements, preferences and internal states. The trend toward naturalistic environments has shown promise in terms of behavioral benefits for animals such as great apes, and there have been several studies of the effects of complex environments on captive apes. However, few recent investigations have objectively compared environmental preferences between two distinct enclosures. In this study, we assessed how ape space use varied within and across two very different environments: an indoor, hardscape enclosure and an indoor/outdoor, naturalistic enclosure. Within-facility tests were conducted by comparing data from behavioral observations of the apes' position in the enclosures to measurements of the space and the availability of individual environmental elements. Between-facility comparisons utilized electivity index calculations to assess both the degree of use for specific features and the degree to which these selections strengthened or weakened in the new facility. Both gorillas and chimpanzees showed significant structural preferences in the older, hardscape environment: positioning themselves by mesh barriers (chimpanzees: P = 0.005; gorillas: P {$<$} 0.001) and corners (P = 0.005; gorillas: P {$<$} 0.001) more than would be expected by random spatial utilization, and avoiding open spaces (chimpanzees: P = 0.005; gorillas: P {$<$} 0.001) not adjacent to any physical structure. A new, naturalistic enclosure was constructed using preference data from the previous facility. In the new facility, both species of ape substantially altered the way in which they chose to position themselves in the enclosure. Chimpanzees used most of the environmental elements at rates more similar to the proportions they were available. While gorilla's preference corners was maintained in the new facility, preferences for doorways and mesh barriers disappeared. Comparing electivity indices facilitated an empirical comparison of space use preferences. Chimpanzees showed significant differences in how they used structural elements (P = 0.021), mesh barriers (P = 0.009) and corners (P = 0.016) in the new facility. Gorillas' environmental selections were similarly altered in the new facility, as selections of areas adjacent to doorways (P = 0.003), glass barriers (P = 0.005), structural elements (P {$<$} 0.001), and mesh barriers (P = 0.012) were all significantly affected by the transfer. This approach is useful for understanding how captive animals utilize their enclosures and we advocate that electivity indices can be added to a growing list of tools to assess the effect of captive environments on animal welfare. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

It is an important factor in elucidating variation in behavior both within and between species. The major focus of this research was to test a method that differs from those used in most previous personality studies, while investigating the personality traits of 52 captive lion-tailed macaques from four zoos. In this study, data from behavioral observations, a P-type principal components analysis (PCA), and bootstrapped confidence intervals as criteria for judging the significance of factor loadings were used rather than subjective ratings, R-type factor analyses, and arbitrary rules of thumb to determine significance. We investigated the relationships among individual component scores and sex, hormonal status, and dominance rank (controlling for age and social group) using a multiple regression analysis with bootstrapped confidence intervals. Three personality dimensions emerged from this analysis: Component 1 contained Extraversion-like behaviors related to sociability and affiliativeness. The higher mean Component score for females suggests that they are more "extraverted" than males. Only agonistic behaviors were significantly related to component 2. High-ranking individuals exhibited higher mean Component 2 scores than mid- or low-ranked individuals. Bold and cautious behaviors both loaded positively on Component 3, suggesting a dimension related to curiosity. The mean Component 3 score for females was higher than the mean score for males. The method used in this study should facilitate intraspecific and general interspecific comparisons. Developing a standardized trait term list that is applicable to many species, and collecting trait term data in the same manner and concurrent with behavioral observations (and physiologic measures when feasible) could prove useful in primate research and should be explored.},

Previous research developed a set of eight priority treatment outcomes generated by patients to complement the professionally developed core sets for RA. Objective This study aimed to facilitate quantitative measurement of these outcomes. Methods Two consultation meetings with patient research partners diagnosed with RA (N=18) were held to identify face validity in existing instruments (Phase 1) at the Bristol Royal Infirmary (BRI). Where validated measures did not exist, new numerical rating scales (NRS) were constructed and discussed at two focus groups with patients diagnosed with RA (N=8) at the BRI and Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases (RNHRD) (Phase 2). Feedback on the stem question, time frame, anchors and layout was recorded and transcribed verbatim. Results Of the 8 priorities, existing NRS for pain, activities of daily living (ADL) and fatigue were voted as acceptable (Phase 1), but new NRS were required for 5 priorities. The partners strongly recommended that the three separate domains of severity, effect and ability to cope in each measurement area be assessed, as in the existing validated fatigue NRS. Focus group participants (Phase 2) made significant contributions to the phrasing of questions, for example how to ensure 'mobility' could be uniformly understood and how changes in valued activities be judged appropriately. Conclusion Through extensive patient feedback 24 numerical rating scales were constructed based on priorities identified by patients and encompassing domains where existing questionnaires contain many more items and do not address three important concepts endorsed by patients: severity, effect and coping. The RAPP-PI PROMs are now ready for the evaluation of comprehension, construct validity and sensitivity through an observational study. Key Points for Decision Makers  Patient research partners can effectively contribute in the identification of face validity in instruments; 3  A clear consensus was reached among RA patients that the each of 8 outcomes should be measured according to three distinct domains: severity, effect and ability to cope.},

We conduct field experiments to test whether the bias extends to the cooperative behavior of one of the most successful modern collectives, the Israeli kibbutz. Despite their promise as universal cooperators, kibbutz members are more cooperative toward anonymous kibbutz members than they are toward anonymous city residents. In fact, when paired with city residents, kibbutz members' observed levels of cooperation are identical to those of city residents. Moreover, self-selection rather than kibbutz socialization largely accounts for the extent to which kibbutz members are cooperative. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

We argue: (a) that traits can best be inferred by sampling from a domain of specific acts and then aggregating across them to gain a representative composite; and (b) that the modification of behaviour largely represents the alteration of specific acts. In particular, we report data showing: (a) that extraversion correlates 0.51 with teaching effectiveness; (b) that this relationship is mediated by specific classroom behaviours; (c) that extraversion correlates 0.33 (on average) with single teaching behaviours, as compared to 0.50 with an aggregate of behaviours; and (d) that training on specific classroom behaviours improves teaching effectiveness. We conclude that both consistency and specificity exist in behaviour and that each provides a useful focus for analysis.

This study sought to promote more natural felid behavior and prevent development or incidence of stereotypies through the use of a feeding enrichment. Our objectives are to use fecal glucocorticoid metabolites values and behavioral observations to quantify the effectiveness of the enrichment device for two species of large cats, Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris tigris; n\,=\,2) and cougar (Felis concolor; n\,=\,2). The feeding enrichment, a white-tailed deer carcass flank securely attached to an AussieDog Products(©) Felid 120-cm bungee, was implemented twice for each individual separated by 1 month. Fecal samples were obtained from each felid and analyzed for pre- and post-enrichment fecal glucocorticoid metabolites (FGM) concentrations using a cortisol enzyme immunoassay. An ethogram with 12 mutual exclusive behavioral categories was utilized to record behavioral responses to the enrichment. Results demonstrate that: 1) there were no differences (P\,{$>$}\,0.05) in FGMs for either species between pre- and post-enrichment; 2) pacing decreased (P\,=\,0.025) and walking increased (P\,=\,0.017) after exposure to enrichment in both cougars; and 3) tigers reduced (P\,=\,0.025) 'other' behavioral category after the first enrichment exposure and laid down more (P\,=\,0.025) after the second enrichment exposure. The neutral hormonal impact on the animals coupled with the behavioral changes indicates that this enrichment is successful at altering the animals' behavior without adding physiological stress to their environments. These findings, combined with the low cost and versatility of the enrichment, promote the use of this enrichment to enhance large felid enclosures.

Although winner and loser effects prevail throughout the animal kingdom and crucially influence social structures, the ultimate and proximate causes for their existence remain unknown. We propose here that two hypotheses are particularly important among the potential adaptive explanations: the 'social-cue hypothesis', which assumes that victory and defeat leave traces that affect the decisions of subsequent opponents; and the 'self-assessment hypothesis', which assumes that winners and losers gain information about their own relative fighting ability in the population. We discuss potential methodologies for experimental tests of the adaptive nature of winner and loser effects.},

  abstract = {Since the 1970s, animal welfare (AW) in Dutch broiler production has been criticized by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the general public. Despite the development of production concepts aimed at improving AW, the conventional concept, which satisfied only the minimum legal requirements, remained by far the most dominant one in the Dutch fresh broiler meat market. Then, quite suddenly, in 2014\&ndash;2015 (i.e., within less than two years), a new broiler concept with increased AW was introduced, which included a slower growing animal, more space, and an improved light regime. This alternative completely replaced the by then conventional concept. The aim of this study was to investigate the origin, causes, and driving forces of this sudden change. Popular and scientific literature, as well as interviews with key players in this transition process, were used to re-construct the chronology of events and draw the main and decisive findings. The latter include: (1) The availability of a cost-efficient alternative to conventional concepts, (2) a basic willingness to change within the entire value chain (including consumers), (3) initiating and triggering actions by NGOs, (4) decisive initiatives by retailers and (5) simultaneous introduction of the new concept and replacement of the conventional concept (i.e., depriving the consumer of a cheaper choice alternative). The result was a real transition of the Dutch fresh meat market without negative purchasing responses of the consumers. It was concluded that, although the Dutch fresh broiler meat market only included 30\% of total domestic production, the existence of the abovementioned decisive factors could bring about an important change in favor of AW within a short period of time.},

  abstract = {Previous studies have posited the use of acoustics-based surveys to monitor population size and estimate their density. However, decreasing the bias in population estimations, such as by using Capture–Mark–Recapture, requires the identification of individuals using supervised classification methods, especially for sparsely populated species like the wolf which may otherwise be counted repeatedly. The cryptic behaviour of Indian wolf (Canis lupus pallipes) poses serious challenges to survey efforts, and thus, there is no reliable estimate of their population despite a prominent role in the ecosystem. Like other wolves, Indian wolves produce howls that can be detected over distances of more than 6~km, making them ideal candidates for acoustic surveys. Here, we explore the use of a supervised classifier to identify unknown individuals. We trained a supervised Agglomerative Nesting hierarchical clustering (AGNES) model using 49 howls from five Indian wolves and achieved 98\% individual identification accuracy. We tested our model’s predictive power using 20 novel howls from a further four individuals (test dataset) and resulted in 75\% accuracy in classifying howls to individuals. The model can reduce bias in population estimations using Capture-Mark-Recapture and track individual wolves non-invasively by their howls. This has potential for studies of wolves’ territory use, pack composition, and reproductive behaviour. Our method can potentially be adapted for other species with individually distinctive vocalisations, representing an advanced tool for individual-level monitoring.},

Offspring were generated from spawns of nine sets of five broodfish (three dams and two sires) in individual brood tanks. Intensive sampling, by trawling, at 2, 7, 8, 10 and 11 days after release of ∼192 500 hatchery-raised fingerlings resulted in recovery of a total of 310 fingerlings. All parents and recovered offspring were genotyped for variation at 30 microsatellites combined for simultaneous assay in six multiplex panels. An optimal combination employing three of the six multiplex panels allowed unambiguous parentage assignment of all recovered offspring. Only 21 of 52 possible dam x sire combinations were represented among recovered offspring. The founder equivalent (fe) of the recovered offspring was 8.7 vs the expected fe of 36.0 (95\% CI = 33.3–38.4) if reproductive success was randomly distributed among breeders. The significantly lower founder equivalent translated into reduced genetic diversity among the recovered offspring and may reflect differing contributions of individual broodfish to spawning events, differing productivity among brood tanks, and/or variable survival of families during early larval and/or juvenile stages.},

We assessed the effects of an ambassador program on the behavior of a colony (N = 15) of zoo-housed African penguins (Spheniscus demersus) and evaluated whether individual characteristics were predictive of participation. Behavioral data were collected for 16 weeks and included 43 \&ldquo;penguin encounters\&rdquo;, during which zoo visitors entered a designated portion of the penguins\&rsquo; enclosure. When comparing colony behavior following encounters to behavior during a matched control period lacking an encounter, we found no significant difference between affiliative or aggressive behaviors, suggesting that the encounters did not disrupt interactions in the colony. The same was true when comparing behavior preceding the encounter to a matched control period, indicating that any anticipatory period was similarly non-disruptive. Space use during encounters suggested comfort near visitors. We also measured penguin temperament on the shy-bold continuum by recording the birds\&rsquo; response to novel objects and found that penguins\&rsquo; temperament, sex, and age were predictive of participation. We concluded that this program had a neutral or positive impact on penguin welfare and considered the findings in relation to aspects of the ambassador program that provided penguins with control over their involvement.},

This study identified a ranking of the importance of drivers of change, a ranking of the biomes with respect to expected changes, and the major sources of uncertainties. For terrestrial ecosystems, land-use change probably will have the largest effect, followed by climate change, nitrogen deposition, biotic exchange, and elevated carbon dioxide concentration. For freshwater ecosystems, biotic exchange is much more important. Mediterranean climate and grassland ecosystems likely will experience the greatest proportional change in biodiversity because of the substantial influence of all drivers of biodiversity change. Northern temperate ecosystems are estimated to experience the least biodiversity change because major land-use change has already occurred. Plausible changes in biodiversity in other biomes depend on interactions among the causes of biodiversity change. These interactions represent one of the largest uncertainties in projections of future biodiversity change.},

An increased level of social behaviors such as aggression can reduce welfare by causing physical damage and chronic stress to animals. Recently, cortisol in hair has been advanced as a non-invasive indicator to quantify long-lasting stress in many species. The sensitivity of social behavior and hair cortisol concentration was evaluated in several groups of dorcas gazelles (Gazella dorcas). Four different groups of gazelles from three different zoos were observed and the expression of intra-specific affiliative and negative social behaviors was assessed across the different groups. Hair samples were taken from subgroups of animals and analyzed for cortisol concentrations. Significant differences between groups of dorcas gazelles were found in frequency of negative social behavior and hair cortisol concentration. Despite the low sample size, these two parameters had a positive Spearman correlation coefficient (r s ¼ þ0.80, P ¼ 0.20). These results suggest that hair cortisol levels are sensitive to differences in the social structure of dorcas gazelles.},

  abstract = {The jaguar Panthera onca is threatened throughout its range and categorized as Near Threat- ened on the IUCN Red List. To inform conservation of the jaguar population in Corcovado National Park, Costa Rica, population size was estimated using data from a 3-month camera trap study. Individuals were identified from their coat patterns. The resulting density estimate of 6.98 ¡ SD 2.36 individuals per 100 km2 was lower than expected. The sex ratio was 1.33 males per female, and the minimum home ranges of two males were 25.64 and 6.57 km2 . Hunting pressure on jaguar and white-lipped peccaries Tayassu pecari, the jaguar’s main prey in the Park, may be responsible for the low jaguar density as space does not seem to be a limiting factor. The numbers of females may have been under- estimated because of sampling bias and therefore the sex ratio obtained in this and similar studies must be interpreted cautiously. Better protection of the corridor that connects the Park with other protected areas is essential to guarantee long-term survival of the jaguar in Costa Rica.},

  abstract = {Adrenal glucocorticoid (GC) secretion is an important component of the response to stress in vertebrates. A short-term increase in circulating GCs serves to redirect energy from processes that can be briefly curtailed without harm, allowing energy to be directed towards eliminating or avoiding the stressor. In contrast, prolonged elevation of GCs can cause a broad range of pathologies, including reproductive suppression. We examined whether social subordination in wolves leads to chronically elevated GC levels, and whether this 'social stress' causes reproductive suppression of subordinates in cooperatively breeding species. Behavioural and endocrine data collected over 2 years from three packs of free-living wolves in Yellowstone National Park did not support this hypothesis. GC levels were significantly higher in dominant wolves than in subordinates, for both sexes, in all packs, in both years of study. Unlike other cooperatively breeding carnivores (e.g. dwarf mongooses, Helogale parvula, and African wild dogs, Lycaon pictus), high GCs in dominant wolves were not associated with high rates of aggression or agonistic interaction. Aggression increased for wolves of all ranks during mating periods, accompanied by a significant rise in GC levels. If chronic elevation of GCs carries fitness costs, then social stress in wolves (and many other social species) is a cost of dominance, not a consequence of subordination. The specific behavioural correlates of dominance that affect GC levels appear to vary among species, even those with similar social systems. ?? 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

  abstract = {KEYWORDS: Depression;depressive symptoms;skin colour;racial discrimination;adolescents BACKGROUND:The relation between race, ethnicity and health has been recognised as having an important role in the understanding of social inequalities in health. In Brazil, miscegenation (the mixing of different ethnicities or races, especially in marriage) is recognised as a sign of racial tolerance, but individuals with black skin colour have poorer social and health indicators than whites. The hypothesis that perceived racial discrimination is associated with depression and depressive symptoms among adolescents living in a Brazilian urban area is analysed, taking into consideration sociodemographic variables, socioeconomic status and skin colour. METHOD: This paper presents results from a cross-sectional study carried out with a random one-stage cluster sampling of households in the city of Salvador, Bahia, Brazil. The study population comprises 973 individuals from 10 to 21 years of age who answered questionnaires about racial discrimination, socio-demographic and health-related variables. Major depression according to DSM-IV criteria was assessed using a validated Portuguese version of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ). The overall prevalence of major depression was estimated as 10.4\%. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were found for prevalence of major depression or any depressive symptom according to skin colour (Black versus non-Black). However, adolescents who reported racial discrimination were more likely to have major depression, even after adjustment for age, sex, socioeconomic status, skin colour and self-esteem (Adjusted Prevalence ratio = 2.00, 95\% Confidence Interval: 1.37–2.97). Low self-esteem was not associated with racial discrimination. CONCLUSION: Depression among adolescents is a common disorder. Skin colour, a biological component of ethnic differences, was not a factor associated with depression or depressive symptoms. Instead, the perception of racial discrimination was a strong potential risk factor for major depression in this population group, which needs to be addressed in further studies and considered in preventive and mental health care programs.},

The hippocampus has been implicated as a suprahypothalamic mediator of such feedback, based on numerous lesion, stimulation, and steroid implantation studies. These reports, however, predated the isolation and characterization of CRF and recognition of the multifactorial control of ACTH release. Thus, it is not clear which hypothalamic ACTH secretagogues are under inhibitory control of the hippocampus. To answer this, we measured hypophysialportal concentrations of CRF, arginine vasopressin, and oxytocin in rats with fornix transections, which disrupt hippocampal communication with the hypothalamus. Hypophysial-portal blood was collected in rats exposed to either low or high circulating corticosterone concentrations in the presence or absence of the coincident stressor of hypotension. We observed that fornix transection produced hypersecretion of all three secretagogues. However, the pattern of hypersecretion differed for each as follows: 1) fornix transection did not affect either initial CRF secretion or the magnitude of the stress response, but made rats resistant to a high feedback signal during stress; 2) fornix transection led to initial arginine vasopressin hypersecretion, which remained sensitive to a high feedback signal; and 3) fornix transection led to initial oxytocin hypersecretion as well as resistance to a high corticosterone feedback signal during hypotension.},

  abstract = {As is clear from the pages of this journal, biological psychiatrists remain fascinated by the phenomenon of dexamethasone (DEX) resistance and the hypercorticosolism of various neuropsychiatric disorders. The mere existence of the endocrine abnormalities attests to the biological reality of these disorders. Furthermore, progress continues in using the occurence of these endocrine defects as both diagnostic and prognostic markers of disease subtypes. Progress has also been made in understanding the mechanisms underlying the endocrine defects. The adrenocortical axis is vastly complex, involving multiple hypothalamic-releasing factors under CNS control, shifting pituitary and adrenal sensitivies to hormonal signals, and feedback regulation at all three levels. What defects within this system produce DEX resistance and hypercortisolism? In this paper, we review data suggesting that the endocrine problems is, at least in part, neural in nature. Drawing upon a rodent literature, we will also suggest some models by which this can occur. The hypercorticolism found in cases of affective disorders, anorexia nervosa, Alzheimer's disease, among the very aged or the chronically stressed, is not a uniform phenomenon. Basal cortisol concentrations can be elevated in all or part of the circadian cycle. Resistance to glucocorticoid (GC) feedback inhibition (as typically demonstrated by DEX resistance) can occur; the resistance can be complete, or occur as early escape from DEX suppression. Finally, elevated basal cortisol concentrations and DEX resistance can occur independently of each other. Until the end of this review, we will conveniently refer to these variants of adrenocortical hyperactivity as "hypercortisolism". In addition, rather than using the term "hypercortisolism" for the rat, we will use "hyperadrenocorticism" (as they secrete corticosterone, rather than cortisol). © 1990.},

This chapter reviews first the nature of stress, the stress- response and stress-related disease, as well as the varieties of hierarchical systems in animals. I then review the literature derived from nonhuman species concerning the connections between rank and functioning of the adrenocortical, cardiovascular, reproductive, and immune systems. As shown here, the relationship is anything but monolithic. Finally, I consider whether rank is a relevant concept in humans and argue that socioeconomic status (SES) is the nearest human approximation to social rank and that SES dramatically influences health.},

  abstract = {The year was 1936, Hans Selye, a young physician just starting off in research at McGill University in Montreal, had a major problem. He had been injecting rats daily with a chemical extract to determine the extract’s effects and had identified consistent changes in the animals: peptic ulcers, atrophy of immune-system tissues and enlargement of the adrenal glands. To his surprise, however, the rats in the control group, which had been injected with saline solution alone, showed identical changes. Most scientists would have thrown up their hands at this paradox. Instead Selye focused on what the two groups had in common: the repeated injections. He wondered if the trio of changes he had identified was actually a generalised physiological response to unpleasantness per se. He then tested that idea and found the same three effects regardless of whether the rats were made too hot or too cold or were exposed to pathogens, toxins or loud noises. Selye borrowed a term from engineering to describe the body’s nonspecific response to an insult. What the rats were undergoing, he decided, was stress. Thus the field of stress physiology was born.},

  abstract = {Lion (Panthera leo) populations have dramatically decreased worldwide with a surviving population estimated at 32,000 across the African savannah. Lions have been kept in captivity for centuries and, although they reproduce well, high rates of stillbirths as well as morbidity and mortality of neonate and young lions are reported. Many of these cases are associated with bone malformations, including foramen magnum (FM) stenosis and thickened tentorium cerebelli. The precise causes of these malformations and whether they are unique to captive lions remain unclear. To test whether captivity is associated with FM stenosis, we evaluated 575 lion skulls of wild (N{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}512) and captive (N{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}63) origin. Tiger skulls (N{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}276; 56 captive, 220 wild) were measured for comparison. While no differences were found between males and females or between subadults and adults in FM height (FMH), FMH of captive lions (17.36±3.20 mm) was significantly smaller and with greater variability when compared to that in wild lions (19.77±2.11 mm). There was no difference between wild (18.47±1.26 mm) and captive (18.56±1.64 mm) tigers in FMH. Birth origin (wild vs. captive) as a factor for FMH remained significant in lions even after controlling for age and sex. Whereas only 20/473 wild lions (4.2\%) had FMH equal to or smaller than the 5th percentile of the wild population (16.60 mm), this was evident in 40.4\% (23/57) of captive lion skulls. Similar comparison for tigers found no differences between the captive and wild populations. Lions with FMH equal to or smaller than the 5th percentile had wider skulls with smaller cranial volume. Cranial volume remained smaller in both male and female captive lions when controlled for skull size. These findings suggest species- and captivity-related predisposition for the pathology in lions.},

  abstract = {The drug rapamycin has important uses in oncology, cardiology, and transplantation medicine, but its clinically relevant molecular effects are not understood. When bound to FKBP12, rapamycin interacts with and inhibits the kinase activity of a multiprotein complex composed of mTOR, mLST8, and raptor (mTORC1). The distinct complex of mTOR, mLST8, and rictor (mTORC2) does not interact with FKBP12-rapamycin and is not thought to be rapamycin sensitive. mTORC2 phosphorylates and activates Akt/PKB, a key regulator of cell survival. Here we show that rapamycin inhibits the assembly of mTORC2 and that, in many cell types, prolonged rapamycin treatment reduces the levels of mTORC2 below those needed to maintain Akt/PKB signaling. The proapoptotic and antitumor effects of rapamycin are suppressed in cells expressing an Akt/PKB mutant that is rapamycin resistant. Our work describes an unforeseen mechanism of action for rapamycin that suggests it can be used to inhibit Akt/PKB in certain cell types. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {UNLABELLED Oral fluid is an attractive alternative matrix for drug testing with a noninvasive and directly observed collection, but there are few controlled cocaine administration studies to guide interpretation. MATERIALS AND METHODS While residing on a closed research unit for up to 10 weeks under constant medical supervision, 19 participants were administered 75 mg/70 kg subcutaneous cocaine and 14 received 150 mg/70 kg. The disposition of cocaine, benzoylecgonine (BE), and ecgonine methyl ester (EME) into oral fluid was determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for 0.08 to 48 hours after administration. RESULTS In oral fluid collected by citric acid candy-stimulated expectoration, cocaine first appeared in oral fluid 0.08 to 0.32 hours after dosing and was rapidly eliminated with half-lives of 1.1 to 3.8 hours. BE and EME were first detected 0.08 to 1.0 hours after dosing with longer half-lives of 3.4 to 13.8 (BE) and 2.4 to 15.5 hours (EME) (P {$<$} 0.05). Oral fluid and plasma concentrations were significantly correlated for cocaine, BE, and EME (P {$<$} 0.0001). There were no significant differences (P {$>$} 0.05) in first and last detection times with the 8-μg/L cutoff proposed by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration or the 10-μg/L cutoff from the European initiative, Driving Under the Influence of Drugs, Alcohol and Medicines. Metabolite:cocaine ratios increased after cocaine administration, potentially helpful for interpreting time of last use. Comparison of oral fluid collection through citric acid candy-stimulated expectoration, citric acid-treated Salivette, and neutral cotton Salivette devices did not reveal significant differences between devices for areas under the curve for cocaine, BE, or EME (P {$>$} 0.05). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION These results provide additional evidence for interpreting cocaine and metabolite concentrations in oral fluid and oral fluid's usefulness as an alternative matrix for drug testing.},

  abstract = {Seyfarth (1977, Journal of Theoretical Biology,65, 671–698) proposed a model of social grooming among female monkeys that has had an enormous influence in the primatological literature. To test this model, I reviewed published data on primate grooming behaviour, using meta-analytical techniques. An analysis of grooming behaviour in 27 different social groups belonging to 14 different species revealed that a significant role in the distribution of grooming was played by attraction to high-ranking animals, attraction to kin and competition for grooming partners. These results confirm the majority of the predictions of the model. The need for more observational data on grooming (and other affiliative interactions) in New World monkeys, and experimental data on the relations between the exchange of grooming and the formation of agonistic alliances, is emphasized.},

A common assumption is that children, like adults, cope with nonstandard pronunciations by relying on words they know (e.g. 'this person pronounces sock as sack, therefore by black she meant block'). In this paper, we assess whether toddlers might additionally use a general expansion strategy, whereby they simply accept non-standard pronunciations when variability is expected. We exposed a group of 24-month-old English-learning toddlers to variability in indexical cues (very diverse voices from native English talkers), and another to variability in social cues (very diverse-looking silent actors); neither group was familiarized with the target novel accent. At test, both groups succeeded in recognizing a novel word when spoken in the novel accent. Thus, even when no lexical cues are available, variability can prepare young children for non-standard pronunciations.},

  abstract = {This paper is a review of the effects of stress on reproduction in fishes. I hope to further the development of the concepts of allostasis and hormesis as relevant to understanding reproduction in general and in fish in particular. The main contentions I derive in this review are the following: Stressors affect fish reproduction in a variety of ways depending on the nature and severity of the stressor. The effects are transduced through a hormonal cascade initiated by perception of the stressor and involving the hypothalamus-pituitary-interrenal axis, the catecholamines, and also cytokines. Mounting a stress response and resisting a stressor is an energetically costly process, including costs associated with allostasis, attempting to reset homeostatic norms. Responses in emergency situations (e.g., being chased by a predator or a net) can be different from those where fish can cope (e.g., being in a more crowded environment) with a stressor, but both situations involve energy re-budgeting. Emergency responses happen in concert with the onset of energy limitations (e.g., the fish may not eat), while coping with allostatic overload can happen in a more energy-rich environment (e.g., the fish can continue to eat). Low levels of stress may have a positive effect on reproductive processes while greater stress has negative effects on fish reproduction. The concept of hormesis is a useful way to think about the effect of stressors on fish reproduction since responses can be nonmonotonal, often biphasic.},

  abstract = {Clustering non-Euclidean data is difficult, and one of the most used algorithms besides hierarchical clustering is the popular algorithm Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM), also simply referred to as k-medoids. In Euclidean geometry the mean-as used in k-means-is a good estimator for the cluster center, but this does not hold for arbitrary dissimilarities. PAM uses the medoid instead, the object with the smallest dissimilarity to all others in the cluster. This notion of centrality can be used with any (dis-)similarity, and thus is of high relevance to many domains such as biology that require the use of Jaccard, Gower, or more complex distances. A key issue with PAM is its high run time cost. We propose modifications to the PAM algorithm to achieve an O(k)-fold speedup in the second SWAP phase of the algorithm, but will still find the same results as the original PAM algorithm. If we slightly relax the choice of swaps performed (at comparable quality), we can further accelerate the algorithm by performing up to k swaps in each iteration. With the substantially faster SWAP, we can now also explore alternative strategies for choosing the initial medoids. We also show how the CLARA and CLARANS algorithms benefit from these modifications. It can easily be combined with earlier approaches to use PAM and CLARA on big data (some of which use PAM as a subroutine, hence can immediately benefit from these improvements), where the performance with high k becomes increasingly important. In experiments on real data with k=100, we observed a 200-fold speedup compared to the original PAM SWAP algorithm, making PAM applicable to larger data sets as long as we can afford to compute a distance matrix, and in particular to higher k (at k=2, the new SWAP was only 1.5 times faster, as the speedup is expected to increase with k).},

  abstract = {Autism is a severe developmental disorder marked by a triad of deficits, including impairments in reciprocal social interaction, delays in early language and communication, and the presence of restrictive, repetitive and stereotyped behaviors. In this review, it is argued that the search for the neurobiological bases of the autism spectrum disorders should focus on the social deficits, as they alone are specific to autism and they are likely to be most informative with respect to modeling the pathophysiology of the disorder. Many recent studies have documented the difficulties persons with an autism spectrum disorder have accurately perceiving facial identity and facial expressions. This behavioral literature on face perception abnormalities in autism is reviewed and integrated with the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) literature in this area, and a heuristic model of the pathophysiology of autism is presented. This model posits an early developmental failure in autism involving the amygdala, with a cascading influence on the development of cortical areas that mediate social perception in the visual domain, specifically the fusiform "face area" of the ventral temporal lobe. Moreover, there are now some provocative data to suggest that visual perceptual areas of the ventral temporal pathway are also involved in important ways in representations of the semantic attributes of people, social knowledge and social cognition. Social perception and social cognition are postulated as normally linked during development such that growth in social perceptual skills during childhood provides important scaffolding for social skill development. It is argued that the development of face perception and social cognitive skills are supported by the amygdala-fusiform system, and that deficits in this network are instrumental in causing autism. © 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of ISDN.},

Major features of sound detection, pitch perception, sound localization, visual spectral sensitivity, visual acuity, learning potential and constraints on learning and memory, and maximum diving depths are presented for these large-brained amphibious marine mammals. Among those species tested, phocids hear higher frequencies under water than do otariids and the opposite is true for airborne sounds. All pinnipeds are more sensitive to underwater sounds than they are to airborne sounds. There is little evidence to support the notion that most pinnipeds have evolved an echolocation capability. Scotopic sensitivity of several species is correlated with radiant energy in the marine environment. Visual acuity is equally sharp in air and under water, but deteriorates more rapidly in air than in water when the ambient light is decreased. Sea lions generally behave optimally' when confronted with ambiguous cues signaling food reward. Although visual form discrimination and generalization is highly developed, thus far abstraction abilities have not been demonstrated easily in pinnipeds. Although many pinnipeds dive to 200-250 m, only the Weddell seal has been observed to dive to 600 m.},

The average per-individual correlation was 0.53. A 2 (sex)??3 (body mass index group: normal, overweight, obese) analysis of variance indicated that men consumed 6 kcal more per bite than women on average.

  pages = {188--188},
  abstract = {Zoo-based research is important both to inform management decisions on captive animals and because zoos, at their best, provide a naturalistic environment, which it is possible to manipulate, in which scientific research can be performed. Extending research to multiple zoos enables investigation into how variations between zoos impact their occupants. Comparing zoo animals to their wild conspecifics can inform management decisions, improve breeding and reintroduction programmes, educate the visiting public and allow assessment of the relevance of zoo-based research to the broader field. The impact of captivity on social animals is particularly interesting, as they cannot determine their own social environment. Meerkats (Suricata suricatta) are a highly social species of mongoose which have been extensively studied in the wild, and which are common in European zoos; they are therefore an ideal focal species with which to assess the impact of aspects of the zoo environment. This thesis presents a study of the behaviour, endocrinology and morphology of meerkats in ten zoos in the UK and one zoo in Germany. The size of captive meerkats' social groups was found to influence their behaviour and faecal glucocorticoid levels (fGCs), with animals in large groups exhibiting lower fGCs, which supports an optimum group size hypothesis. Meerkats in large groups also spent less time on sentry duty, although a sentry was posted more often in zoos than in the wild, reinforcing the model of state-dependent vigilance. Captive meerkats were found to weigh much more, on average, than their wild conspecifics, with 86.7\% of adults more than two standard deviations heavier than the mean weight in the wild. Meerkats in larger enclosures were heavier than those in smaller ones; their weights also correlated with climate, with zoos in cool, dry locations having lighter meerkats. This research did not find that high levels of hormonal stress occur frequently in zoo meerkats, but obesity may pose a health threat to many individuals and its impacts should be a priority for veterinary research. 2 Acknowledgements},

  abstract = {In western North America, Rocky Mountain national parks represent a major resource for nature-based tourism. This paper examines how climate change may influence park tourism in the Rocky Mountain region by focusing on both the direct and indirect impacts of climate change for visitation to Waterton Lakes National Park (WLNP) (Alberta, Canada). A statistical model of monthly visitation and climate was developed to examine the direct impact of climate change on visitation. The model projected that annual visitation would increase between 6\% and 10\% in the 2020s and between 10\% and 36\% in the 2050s. To explore how climate-induced environmental change could also indirectly affect visitation, a visitor survey was used (N = 425). The environmental change scenarios for the 2020s and 2050s were found to have minimal influence on visitation, however the environmental change scenario for the 2080s (under the warmest climate change conditions) was found to have a negative effect on visitation, as 19\% of respondents indicated they would not visit the park and 37\% stated they would visit the park less often. The contrasting result of the two analyses for the longer-term impact of climate change was a key finding. The management implications of these findings and methodological challenges associate with climate change impact assessment for tourism are also discussed. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

One hundred and eighty four undergraduates completed a survey assessing personality and Facebook behaviors and motivations. High agreeableness and neuroticism were the best predictors of belongingness-related behaviors and motivations. Extraversion was associated with more frequent use of Facebook to communicate with others. Self-presentational behaviors and motivations were best predicted by low conscientiousness and high neuroticism. Results suggest that conscientious individuals are cautious in their online self-presentation. Neuroticism, agreeableness, and extraversion were positively associated with the tendency to express one's actual self. Neuroticism was positively associated with the expression of ideal and hidden self-aspects. The motivation to express these self-aspects mediated the relationship between neuroticism and self-disclosure. © 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

These improvements had been thought to occur only when attention is focused on the stimuli to be learned (task-relevant learning) but recent studies demonstrate performance improvements outside the focus of attention (task-irrelevant learning). Here, we propose a unified model that explains both task-relevant and task-irrelevant learning. The model suggests that long-term sensitivity enhancements to task-relevant or irrelevant stimuli occur as a result of timely interactions between diffused signals triggered by task performance and signals produced by stimulus presentation. The proposed mechanism uses multiple attentional and reinforcement systems that rely on different underlying neuromodulators. Our model provides insights into how neural modulators, attentional and reinforcement learning systems are related.},

  abstract = {The t-test is used as an example of the basic principles of statistical inference. One of the simplest situations for which we might design an experiment is the case of a nominal two-level explanatory variable and a quantitative outcome variable. Table 6.1 shows several examples. For all of these experiments, the treat-ments have two levels, and the treatment variable is nominal. Note in the table the various experimental units to which the two levels of treatment are being applied for these examples.. If we randomly assign the treatments to these units this will be a randomized experiment rather than an observational study, so we will be able to apply the word " causes " rather than just " is associated with " to any statisti-cally significant result. This chapter only discusses so-called " between subjects " explanatory variables, which means that we are assuming that each experimental unit is exposed to only one of the two levels of treatment (even though that is not necessarily the most obvious way to run the fMRI experiment). This chapter shows one way to perform statistical inference for the two-group, quantitative outcome experiment, namely the independent samples t-test. More importantly, the t-test is used as an example for demonstrating the basic principles of statistical inference that will be used throughout the book. The understanding of these principles, along with some degree of theoretical underpinning, is key to using statistical results intelligently. Among other things, you need to really understand what a p-value and a confidence interval tell us, and when they can 141},

  abstract = {Seasonality of reproduction is observed in many species of organisms, across taxa, and is influenced by both biotic and abiotic factors. While such seasonality is easy to understand in temperate species exposed to extreme climates, it is more difficult to explain in the tropics. In many tropical species offspring are born during the season of high precipitation, which also coincides with high resource availability. Interestingly, in India, free-ranging dogs seem to mate, and not whelp, when it rains-an observation that cannot be explained by the resource abundance hypothesis. We carried out an extensive study to identify the mating seasons of free-ranging dogs, and observed a strong correlation between both the incidence and frequency of mating related behaviours of dogs, and precipitation levels. There are two clear mating seasons, of which the primary mating season coincides with the monsoon (rainy season) and the secondary mating season coincides with the nor'westerlies in this part of India. We speculate that this strong correlation is an effect of chemistry, rather than biology. While male dogs can mate round the year, females come into estrous seasonally. In the urban environment, dogs are exposed to a lot of olfactory noise, which can dilute the signal present in sex pheromones of the females in heat. A shower leads to increased humidity and reduced temperature of the air, leading to intensification of pheromone signals that trigger a sexual response in the dogs.},

Despite their inherently cross-sectional nature, postmortem studies have enabled the staging of the progression of both amyloid and tangle pathologies, and, consequently, the development of diagnostic criteria that are now used worldwide. In addition, clinicopathological correlation studies have been crucial to generate hypotheses about the pathophysiology of the disease, by establishing that there is a continuum between "normal" aging and AD dementia, and that the amyloid plaque build-up occurs primarily before the onset of cognitive deficits, while neurofibrillary tangles, neuron loss, and particularly synaptic loss, parallel the progression of cognitive decline. Importantly, these cross-sectional neuropathological data have been largely validated by longitudinal in vivo studies using modern imaging biomarkers such as amyloid PET and volumetric MRI.},

Here, we review behavioral studies that suggest that Pavlovian processes can exert an important influence over choice and may account for many effects that have traditionally been attributed to emotion. We illustrate how recent experiments cast light on the underlying structure of Pavlovian control and argue that generally this influence makes good computational sense. Corresponding neuroscientific data from both animals and humans implicate a central role for the amygdala through interactions with other brain areas. This yields a neurobiological account of emotion in which it may operate, often covertly, to optimize rather than corrupt economic choice. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Plasma noradrenaline (NA), adrenaline (A), and corticosterone (CS) responses to social and nonsocial stressors were studied in male members of a strain of wild-type rats, widely differing in their level of aggression. The aggessiveness was preliminarily established by measuring the latency time to attack (ALT) a male intruder in a standard resident-intruder test. Animals were then provided with a jugular vein cannula for blood sampling during stress exposure. Implanted rats were randomly assigned to 3 experimental treatments: social stress (defeat experience, SD), nonsocial stress (presentation of a shock-prod, SP) and control (animals undisturbed in their home cages, CTR). A significant correlation was found between ALT and the amount of time spent in burying the probe in SP rats: the more aggressive the animal, the higher the rate of burying behavior. SD induced a much stronger effect on plasma NA, A, and CS concentrations than SP. A significant negative correlation was found between ALT scores and values of the area under the response time curve for NA and A, in both SD and SP situations: the more aggressive the animal, the higher the catecholaminergic reactivity to the stressors. On the contrary, no evidence of a correlation between aggressiveness and plasma corticosterone responses was found, neither in SD nor in SP rats. These findings in an unselected strain of wild-type rats confirmed that an aggressive/active coping strategy is associated with a high sympathetic-adrenomedullary activation and support the concept of individual differentiation in coping styles as a coherent set of behavioral and neuroendocrine characteristics.},

  abstract = {The human\&ndash;animal relationship is an important welfare parameter in animal welfare assessment in cows, and the avoidance distance of cows to a stranger at the feed bunk is measured to assess this relationship. The assessment of the human\&ndash;animal relationship in cow shelters in India, where old, unproductive, and abandoned cows are sheltered, is important to explore the welfare of cows in these shelters. The cows observed were of indigenous Indian breeds and breeds which were crosses between indigenous breeds and pure bred exotic cows. The human\&ndash;animal contact in this context is of particular interest for welfare assessment as traditional Indian farming and sheltering systems involves regular close human\&ndash;animal contact. In a cross-sectional study across 6 states, 54 cow shelters were visited and 30 cows in each shelter were randomly selected (1620 in total) for the assessment of avoidance distance and other cow-based (27 parameters) and resource-based (15 parameters) welfare parameters. Avoidance distance was assessed 1 h after morning feeding. Cows standing at the feeding manger were approached from the front at a rate of one step/s, starting 2 m away from the manger. The distance between the assessor\&rsquo;s hand and the cow\&rsquo;s head was estimated at the moment the cow moved away and turned its head, using a four-point scale (0, touched; 1, 0\&ndash;50 cm; 2, 51\&ndash;100 cm; and 3, \&gt;100 cm). The majority, 52\%, of the cows allowed touch by the assessor and another 32\% allowed approach within 50 cm, demonstrating tolerance, or even solicitation of close human\&ndash;animal relationships by the cows. Avoidance distance increased with the proportion of cows with dirty hind limbs, tarsal joint swellings, and hair loss, and the extent of rumen fill. There was also evidence of reduced avoidance distances in cows with high levels of body condition score (BCS), dirty flanks, tarsal joint ulceration, carpal joint injuries, diarrhoea, hampered respiration, lesions on the body due to traumatic injuries, and body coat condition, probably as a result of moving difficulties. The avoidance distance was thus related to the health and welfare of the cows, providing a vital insight into the factors affecting human\&ndash;animal contact in the shelters.},

  abstract = {The sheltering of old, unproductive and abandoned cows in traditional cow shelters, known as gaushalas, has been practiced in India since ancient times. Cows are kept in these shelters until they die of natural causes. The welfare of the cows in these shelters was assessed through a cross-sectional study of 54 cow shelters in six states of India. A total of 1620 cows were examined to assess the prevalence of lameness in these cows, and the associated risk factors for lameness were identified through the measurement of animal-based and resource-based welfare indicators. The overall lameness prevalence was 4.2\%. The majority (86\%) had mild to moderate hock joint swellings but no or only mild carpal joint injuries. Approximately one-half had mild to moderate hock joint hair loss and most were free of hock joint ulcerations. Claw overgrowth was present in almost one half of the cows. Lameness prevalence was positively correlated with coat dirtiness, hock and carpal joint lesions, diarrhea and claw overgrowth scores. In a multivariate analysis, lameness prevalence increased as the Body Condition Score (BCS) decreased and was associated with increased udder dirtiness, the ulceration of the hock joint, carpal joint injuries and claw overgrowth. Resource-based indicators measured at the shelter level suggested that an absence of bedding in the sheds and an increase in the gradient of the shed flooring increased lameness. Addressing the principle risk factors identified for lameness in the sheltered cows (low body condition, dirty udders, lesions on the hock and carpal joints, overgrown claws, and a steep floor gradient) may help to reduce this serious animal welfare problem.},

Alternatively, linear mixed models (LMM) are commonly used to understand changes in human behavior over time. In this paper, the basic concepts surrounding LMM (or hierarchical linear models) are outlined. Although SPSS is a statistical analyses package commonly used by researchers, documentation on LMM procedures in SPSS is not thorough or user friendly. With reference to this limitation, the related procedures for performing analyses based on LMM in SPSS are described. To demonstrate the application of LMM analyses in SPSS, findings based on six waves of data collected in the Project P.A.T.H.S.

  abstract = {Many studies have recently focused on stress as a marker of an animal's well being. Since animals respond to a stressor by increasing their glucocorticoid (GC) levels there has been much interest in measuring these hormones. Fecal GC analyses have been used in a wide range of studies as they are an easily obtained, non-invasive measure of these stress hormones. However, these analyses rest on two major assumptions. First, they assume that fecal GC metabolites reflect free, biologically active levels of GCs in the plasma. Second, they assume that differences in fecal GC metabolite levels among animals are an accurate reflection of their physiological state and thus of their ability to respond to a stressor. We tested these assumptions in a population of free-ranging snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) in the southwestern Yukon, from 2006 to 2008. Both assumptions were verified. Plasma free cortisol levels mirrored bile and fecal cortisol metabolite (FCM) levels, but plasma total cortisol levels did not. Differences in FCM concentrations among hares robustly predicted their response to a hormonal challenge. Hares with higher FCM concentrations showed a greater resistance to the suppression of their free plasma cortisol following a dexamethasone injection and a more marked increase of free plasma cortisol following an ACTH injection. Furthermore, we found that changes in FCM concentrations in autumn and winter over two years reliably tracked changes in plasma free cortisol levels obtained from the hormonal challenge test. These results indicate that both fecal and plasma measures of an animal's stress physiology are concordant: they tell the same story. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {Cruelty- and neglect-related canine welfare concerns are important welfare and social issues. Dog breed has been identified as a risk factor for bad welfare, and yet its role in different types of canine welfare concerns has not been fully investigated. We conducted a retrospective study of 107,597 dog welfare complaints received by RSPCA Queensland from July 2008 to June 2018. The breed of the dog involved in the incident was either recorded as stated by the complainant or by the inspector attending the case. Dog breed was divided into groups following the Australian National Kennel Club nomenclature. Dogs of a non-recognised breed were more likely to be reported in welfare complaints than recognised breed dogs. Recognised breed dogs had a greater risk of being reported with poisoning, lack of veterinary support, abuse and being left unattended in a hot vehicle; while non-recognised breed dogs had greater risk of being reported with insufficient shelter, exercise and food/water, as well as overcrowding and abandonment. Utility breeds, terriers and working dogs were most likely to be reported, while toy, non-sporting breeds and gundogs were least likely to be reported. Common complaint types for utility dogs were: insufficient food/water, shelter and exercise, and poor living conditions; for terriers: abandonment, intentional abuses and killing or injuring another animal; for working dogs: insufficient food/water, shelter and exercise; for toy dogs: lack of veterinary care, overcrowding and staying in a hot vehicle alone; for non-sporting dogs: lack of veterinary care, being left in a hot vehicle unattended and poor body conditions; and for hounds: killing or injuring another animal, intentional abuses and poor body conditions. Breed groups rather than breeds may be the best method of breed identification in a public reporting system as they group similar breeds together, and as our research shows, they relate to types of animal welfare complaints. Understanding the relationship between breed group and canine welfare complaints may help authorities improve public education programs and inform decision-making around which breed a new owner should choose.},

Chemical peels and microbeads have been used to overcome this layer, but these methods can cause side effects and are not environmentally friendly. While microneedles do not share the dangers mentioned above, they are currently only available as patches, which makes them unsuitable to be used with products that are usually applied onto a large area of the skin surface. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop microneedle-like particles (MLP) whose needles would disrupt the skin during the rubbing process. A modified approach taken from conventional micromolding techniques was used to make the MLPs. The experimental results show that the fabricated structures had the required mechanical strength. Furthermore, after the application of the MLPs, the permeability of two fluorescent dyes, fluorescein sodium salt and sulforhodamine B increased to 217.6\% ± 25.6\% and 251.7\% ± 12.8\% respectively. Additionally, the permeability of a model drug, niacinamide, was shown to have increased to 193.8\% ± 29.9\%. Cryosectioned porcine slices also confirmed the ability of MLPs to enhance skin permeability by revealing a deeper penetration of the applied fluorescent dye. Altogether, the results demonstrate the potential of MLPs to be used as safe skin permeability enhancers that can be applied all over the skin.},

These snakes are large elapids of cool to cold climates in southeastern Australia. Australian elapids mainly eat small prey, and foraging theory therefore predicts that they should be relatively unselective with respect to prey type and prey size. The diet of copperheads is very broad, including most of the locally available terrestrial vertebrates. Of 216 prey items, 66\% were scincid lizards and 27\% were frogs. Most prey items were very small, and there was no apparent relationship between prey and predator sizes. The proportion of snakes containing prey was consistently lower in juveniles than in adults, and lower in gravid females than in non-gravid females. Austrelaps ramsayi and A. superbus are similar in body size, with A. labialis much smaller: all are similar ecologically. Males grow much larger than females, and are more numerous in museum collections. All three species are viviparous, with ovulation in spring and parturition in late summer. Only about two-thirds of adult-size females collected in summer were reproductive, suggesting that individual females may not reproduce every year. Litter sizes varied from 3 to 32, with means of 7.4 in A. labialis, 14.6 in A. superbus, and 15.0 in A. ramsayi. The lower fecundity in A. labialis is attributed to smaller maternal body size: the relationship between maternal SVL and litter size is similar among the three species. Size at birth is also similar.},

We developed an easy and accurate molecular approach to assess occurrence of prey species in the diet of free-ranging wolves (Canis lupus) and compared the results to analyses of prey hair in the same scat samples collected from northeastern Alberta, Canada. Species-specific mitochondrial DNA primers detected 1.34 times more prey occurrences from scats, and more readily differentiated similar ungulate species such as woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) and deer (Odocoileus sp.) than morphological methods. These findings suggest that molecular analysis of prey in carnivore scat are objective, reproducible and, can help promote effective conservation and management of carnivore species at risk of conflict with humans.},

Secondary objectives were to determine whether buckthorn abundance in gaps is related to gap size, and whether or not buckthorn exhibits advanced regeneration. The abundance of glossy buckthorn was estimated in five patch cuts and three single-tree cuts in a 90 year old eastern hemlock-eastern white pine-sweet birch forest at the Woodman Horticultural Farm in Durham, NH, USA. Glossy buckthorn was 96 times more abundant in logged areas than in uncut control plots. The three largest but youngest gaps 0.08 ha; 5 years old) had the greatest proportion of tall 2 m), reproductively mature glossy buckthorn individuals, with 18.4\% fruiting. The older, medium-sized gaps (ca. 0.03 ha; 10 years old) contained the highest overall densities of glossy buckthorn, but few stems were flowering (similar to 2\%) and none were fruiting at the time of sampling. Small gaps 0.01 ha; 10 years old) appeared to be sinks for glossy buckthorn, as all individuals were 4 years old. As age and size of gaps were correlated, it was difficult to determine which factor played a larger role in the establishment and persistence of glossy buckthorn. However, the greater proportion of individuals {$>$} 2 m tall and greater reproductive vigor of glossy buckthorn in large gaps relative to small gaps-despite fewer years available for growth-suggest that larger disturbances lead to more resources available for buckthorn growth, survival, and reproduction. Individuals {$<$} 0.5 m tall were observed in uncut control plots at low density 30 stems/ha) and 5\% of stems in large gaps were older than the gaps themselves, suggesting that gap formation released previously established glossy buckthorn individuals (i.e., advanced regeneration).},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}This dissertation explores the colonization of wildlife in nineteenth and early twentieth century British India. It discusses hunting and colonial policies on wildlife to explore the political, social and cultural concerns that influenced British interactions with Indian wildlife, with their compatriots and with natives. Hunting, I argue was deeply implicated in the exercise of power in all these interactions. 	British policies on wildlife in the nineteenth century favored a neat categorization of wild animals as "vermin and "game." By the beginning of the twentieth century however, with decreasing numbers of carnivores and native opposition, the perceived complementarily between game preservation and vermin extermination was shattered. While the colonial administration continued both these policies, they also actively sought to formulate policies to protect all animals in areas designated as sanctuaries and national parks. 	Colonial hunting as it emerged from the late nineteenth century reflects the changing nature of the colonial state and a new imperial ideology of dominance. I also argue racial differences between the colonialists and colonized were articulated in the domain of hunting. While hunting represented domination of nature and natives, the "colonial hunt" also came to signify a paternal benevolent British rule. The importance given to hunting and to the notion of fair play in their hunting served to "identify" the moral and physical superiority of British rulers. The new ideology of paternalism was realized in the figure of the hunter-officer, the Sahib who in hunting dangerous carnivores was seen to act as a protector of the native.  	The changing nature of the colonial state and creation of racial differences also had  a profound impact on colonial society which became increasingly self conscious of its own identity and image. Given the metropolitan engagement with social Darwinism and their location on the fringes of civilization as it were, colonialists became the center of metropolitan preoccupation with racial contamination. The emphasis on fair play, I argue reflects the efforts of the colonial elite to enforce a model code of conduct on its members and reassure an anxious metropole of the racial distance with the native. Policing behavior of their own, through categories like fair play was therefore essential to the agenda of creating racial differences. Due to a perceived connection between hunting, power and privilege, hunting also played an important role in social relations in colonial society. As hunting came to be regulated by laws by late nineteenth century, it often became the focal point of tensions in class and power within the colonial elite on the question of access to animals.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Maternal deprivation can cause long-term behavioral changes in captive mammals. Studies regarding captive ungulates have also indicated behavioral shifts in the presence of the animal keeping staff; however, little is known about these effects in captive giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis). To examine this, we observed a population of reticulated giraffes composed of maternally raised and maternally deprived individuals by direct and camera observations at Binder Park Zoo, Battle Creek, Michigan. We conducted observations using a unique ethogram with special regard for behaviors that might indicate stress or anti-social tendencies. Several variables can interact to create behavioral changes; to account for this, our study design examined the interactive effects of observation technique, raising style, and temperature on giraffe behavior. The results of these observations showed a significant increase in the rate of stereotypic and antisocial behaviors resulting from the interaction of observation technique and raising style. Stereotypic behaviors in particular showed a marked increased during cooler temperatures among giraffes of all raising style. Likewise, raising style, observation technique, and their interaction significantly impacted the time spent rubbing the enclosure. The findings of this study suggest that captive giraffe behavior can be a complex response to multiple factors and studies only examining single factors might oversimplify behavioral shifts.},

Animal personality has been proposed to emerge as an adaptation to individual differences in state variables, leading to the question of why individuals differ consistently in state. Recent theory emphasizes the role that positive feedbacks between state and behaviour can play in producing consistent among-individual covariance between state and behaviour, hence state-dependent personality. We review the role of feedbacks in recent models of adaptive personalities, and provide guidelines for empirical testing of model assumptions and predictions. We discuss the importance of the mediating effects of ecology on these feedbacks, and provide a roadmap for including state-behaviour feedbacks in behavioural ecology research.},

  abstract = {Recent studies suggest that populations and species often exhibit behavioral syndromes; that is, suites of correlated behaviors across situations. An example is an aggression syndrome where some individuals are more aggressive, whereas others are less aggressive across a range of situations and contexts. The existence of behavioral syndromes focuses the attention of behavioral ecologists on limited (less than optimal) behavioral plasticity and behavioral carryovers across situations, rather than on optimal plasticity in each isolated situation. Behavioral syndromes can explain behaviors that appear strikingly non-adaptive in an isolated context (e.g. inappropriately high activity when predators are present, or excessive sexual cannibalism). Behavioral syndromes can also help to explain the maintenance of individual variation in behavioral types, a phenomenon that is ubiquitous, but often ignored. Recent studies suggest that the behavioral type of an individual, population or species can have important ecological and evolutionary implications, including major effects on species distributions, on the relative tendencies of species to be invasive or to respond well to environmental change, and on speciation rates. Although most studies of behavioral syndromes to date have focused on a few organisms, mainly in the laboratory, further work on other species, particularly in the field, should yield numerous new insights.},

  abstract = {The collared peccary, Pecari tajacu, is a mammal in the family Tayassuidae from the Americas that occurs from the United States to north Argentina and throughout Brazil. They are very sociable animals, living in groups of six to nine individuals. In their natural habitat, they present diurnal habits, but in captivity, this behaviour may change due to management conditions. Despite being bred in captivity for both commercial and conservation purposes, little is known about their behavioural patterns. The aim of this study was to construct an ethogram and produce a time-activity budget for captive collared peccaries in order to suggest better practices for husbandry and welfare. Thirty-nine captive-born peccaries were studied. The ethogram and time-activity budget of the individuals were constructed using the ad libitum method, with data collection at different times between 08:00 and 12:00 and between 13:00 and 17:00. One hundred and seventy-nine hours of data were collected for each period (8:00–9:00; 9:00–10:00; 10:00–11:00, etc.). We identified 87 behaviours exhibited by the collared peccaries, most of them recorded in the afternoon, between 14:00 h and 15:00 h. Most of the time, the peccaries remained inactive. Three behaviours were recorded for the first time (playing in mud, weak biting and tasting). Inactivity of the collared peccaries increased with increasing temperature (rs = 0.261, p {$<$} 0.001), whereas active behavioural categories decreased with increasing temperature (rs = −0.179, p = 0.003). The high rate of inactivity may have been due to the influence of temperature, as on warmer days they remained more inactive than on colder days. No signs of low welfare were found based on the ethogram (no abnormal behaviours were observed). The ethogram and the time-activity budget created allow for more targeted husbandry procedures, such as actions that increase the activity of animals.},

Among the different cosmetic actives, antioxidants are incorporated in anti-ageing products due to their beneficial effects in preventing and minimizing the signs of skin ageing. This work aims to understand how anti-ageing formulations changed in the past 7~years regarding pure antioxidants composition. METHODS: Data were collected from anti-ageing formulations commercialized in main stores and pharmacies in the Portuguese market. The study started on 2011 and was updated with products launched or whose composition has been renewed on 2013, 2015 or 2018. RESULTS: Ascorbic acid and tocopherol and their derivatives were consistently the most used antioxidants in anti-ageing formulations; followed by niacinamide and retinyl palmitate. Seven ascorbic acid derivatives are currently used in anti-ageing formulations while only three tocopherol derivatives were identified in this study. Several combinations of antioxidants were routinely found, mainly tocopherol (or tocopherol derivatives) with other antioxidants and tocopherol with tocopherol derivatives. We have not identified emerging antioxidants with great impact in anti-ageing formulations even though niacinamide and retinyl palmitate exhibited over 10\% more usage in 2018. CONCLUSION: This insight is relevant to the cosmetic industry providing a better understanding of the scientific-based formulation of modern cosmetics and supports the need for innovative antioxidants in anti-ageing cosmetics.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial mouthrinses often are used as part of daily oral care to reduce plaque and gingivitis. Although several safety factors have been associated with long-term use of alcohol-containing mouthrinses, numerous studies support the safety of these products in daily care. Patient compliance with daily rinsing is important for successful outcomes. TYPES OF STUDIES REVIEWED: The authors reviewed studies relating to the safety and efficacy of alcohol-containing mouthrinses, as well as studies indicating that most patients fail to comply with oral health care recommendations. The authors also reviewed a behavioral change theory and applied it to oral health care. CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol-containing antimicrobial mouthrinses are safe and effective as part of a daily oral care regimen to prevent or minimize periodontal disease. However, many patients do not comply with instructions on how to use them. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Antimicrobial mouthrinses are safe and effective, and when used in conjunction with brushing and flossing, they are an important method of reducing plaque and gingivitis. To improve compliance, dental health care professionals should adapt oral health care recommendations to fit patients' specific needs.},

  abstract = {Understanding what might motivate livestock stakeholders to improve animal welfare is useful information when developing initiatives that benefit from stakeholder engagement. This study was designed to assess the strength of motivating drivers in the development of attitudes to animal welfare, and the factors that impacted their ability to improve animal welfare. During a series of qualitative focus group sessions with livestock leaders across the same countries (Malaysia, China, Vietnam and Thailand), the current study presented livestock leaders (n = 139) with the most significant results in their country, and collected data pertaining to the meaning and applicability of these results. This data was then subject to thematic analysis to identify salient and repeated motivating factors and meanings. This process revealed a complex picture of relationships between motivators and the contexts that drive them. Figures are presented to begin illustrating these relationships. Some strong motivators were uncovered that were previously rated low in the survey (i.e., financial benefit) or not included at all (e.g., food safety). This paper also presents the opportunity to better understand the strength and relationship of extrinsic and intrinsic motivational forces behind animal welfare improvement.},

  abstract = {This article reports the structure of dominance and its relationship with social grooming in wild lion-tailed macaque females. The strength of dominance hierarchy was 0.79 on a scale of 0 to 1 indicating a moderate linearity in the ranking system. Dominance scores were converted into an ordinal as well as an interval scale. Grooming scores were also converted into interval scales using standard scores. Grooming received and grooming given correlated positively and negatively respectively with dominance ranks indicating that high ranking females received more and gave less grooming. Grooming was also positively related to encounter rates for dyads of females. More grooming among adjacent ranks, and grooming being more reciprocal, occurred only in the case of dominant females. The grooming patterns, therefore, appeared to be more of despotic than egalitarian nature. While ranking macaques into different Grades of social systems ranging from despotic to egalitarian, Thierry (2004) has placed lion-tailed macaques in Grade 3 corresponding to the ‘relaxed’ social system. Our results indicate that the grooming and dominance relationships in this species are more despotic, and hence, the Grade for this species requires to be shifted toward 2 or 1.},

  abstract = {The Green Revolution in India has achieved self-sufficiency in food production. However, in the state of Haryana this has resulted in continuous environmental degradation, particularly of soil, vegetation and water resources. Soil organic matter levels are declining and the use of chemical inputs is intensifying. Newly introduced crop varieties have been responsive to inputs but this has necessitated both increased fertiliser application and use of irrigation resulting in water contamination by nitrate and phosphate and changes in the ground water table. With 82\% of the geographic area already under cultivation, the scope for increased productivity lies in further intensification which is crucially dependent on more energy-intensive inputs. Declining nutrient-use efficiency, physical and chemical degradation of soil, and inefficient water use have been limiting crop productivity, whilst the use of monocultures, mechanisation and an excessive reliance on chemical plant protection have reduced crop, plant and animal diversity in recent years. About 60\% of the geographical area faces soil degradation (waterlogging, salinity and alkalinity) which threatens the region's food security in the future. Since 1985, the water table has risen more than 1 m annually, and patches of salinity have started to appear at the farm level. The situation is worse m higher rainfall areas where waterlogging follows shortly after the rains. Apart from affecting agricultural crops, a high water table causes floods even following slight rains due to the reduced storage capacity of the soil. Such ecological impacts are motivating farmers to reduce fertiliser and pesticides use. This has led to an increased investment in alternative technology and products including an interest in Integrated Pest Management. The paper discusses major physical, hydrological, chemical and biological constraints relating to soil and water resources for ecosystem sustainability. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

  abstract = {High fliers Migrating from hemisphere to hemisphere is a global strategy for many bird species. Despite allowing birds to track productivity, these long-distance movements bring them in contact with inhospitable regions such as deserts and oceans. Sjöberg et al. used geolocators to monitor flight in great reed warblers (Acrocephalus arundinaceus) and found that when over these types of regions, this normally nocturnal migrating species flew both day and night. During the day, the birds increased the altitudes at which they flew, rising to more than 5000 meters. Such behavior may allow them to avoid heat stress or other daytime threats during migration. Science, this issue p. 646 Billions of nocturnally migrating songbirds fly across oceans and deserts on their annual journeys. Using multisensor data loggers, we show that great reed warblers (Acrocephalus arundinaceus) regularly prolong their otherwise strictly nocturnal flights into daytime when crossing the Mediterranean Sea and the Sahara Desert. Unexpectedly, when prolonging their flights, they climbed steeply at dawn, from a mean of 2394 meters above sea level to reach extreme cruising altitudes (mean 5367 and maximum 6267 meters above sea level) during daytime flights. This previously unknown behavior of using exceedingly high flight altitudes when migrating during daytime could be caused by diel variation in ambient temperature, winds, predation, vision range, and solar radiation. Our finding of this notable behavior provides new perspectives on constraints in bird flight and might help to explain the evolution of nocturnal migration. To cross the Mediterranean Sea and the Sahara Desert, nocturnally migrating great reed warblers climb to high cruising altitudes at dawn. To cross the Mediterranean Sea and the Sahara Desert, nocturnally migrating great reed warblers climb to high cruising altitudes at dawn.},

Tanning is a type of risky behaviour, which has been found to be hard to change, particularly in the groups where it is most risky (children and adolescents). Exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UV), protective behaviour and risk perception with regard to tanning were investigated with a postal questionnaire in a large representative sample of Swedish teenagers 13, 15 and 17 years old (n=2615). Risky behaviour was most prevalent among girls and older respondents, in spite of their greater awareness of the risks, and the general female tendency towards risk avoidance. Cosmetic and social motives seemed to drive this type of risk taking behaviour. Comparisons of perceived personal risks of tanning and risks to other people as well as perceived control over the risks, showed personal risks to be perceived as smaller than risks to others, and perceived control to be an important factor in this form of unrealistic optimism. Although people may have more or less valid perceptions of the risks to others, they tend to have overly optimistic views of their personal risks when it comes to tanning. Risk communication is particularly difficult in cases like this. The problem of stimulating more prudent behaviour in teenagers with regard to tanning is discussed.},

  abstract = {Abstract: The most comprehensive data on many species come from scientific collections. Thus, we developed a method of population viability analysis (PVA) in which this type of occurrence data can be used. In contrast to classical PVA, our approach accounts for the inherent observation error in occurrence data and allows the estimation of the population parameters needed for viability analysis. We tested the sensitivity of the approach to spatial resolution of the data, length of the time series, sampling effort, and detection probability with simulated data and conducted PVAs for common, rare, and threatened species. We compared the results of these PVAs with results of standard method PVAs in which observation error is ignored. Our method provided realistic estimates of population growth terms and quasi-extinction risk in cases in which the standard method without observation error could not. For low values of any of the sampling variables we tested, precision decreased, and in some cases biased estimates resulted. The results of our PVAs with the example species were consistent with information in the literature on these species. Our approach may facilitate PVA for a wide range of species of conservation concern for which demographic data are lacking but occurrence data are readily available. Resumen: Los datos más completos sobre muchas especies provienen de colecciones científicas. Por lo tanto, desarrollamos un método de análisis de viabilidad poblacional (AVP) en el que se puede utilizar este tipo de datos de ocurrencia. En contraste con el AVP clásico, nuestro método toma en cuenta el error de observación inherente en los datos de ocurrencia y permite la estimación de los parámetros poblacionales requeridos para el análisis de viabilidad. Probamos la sensibilidad del método a la resolución espacial de los datos, la longitud de las series de tiempo, el esfuerzo de muestreo y la probabilidad de detección con datos simulados y realizamos AVP de especies comunes, raras y amenazadas. Comparamos los resultados de estos AVP con resultados de AVP realizados con métodos estándar en los que se ignora el error de observación. Nuestro método proporcionó estimaciones realistas del crecimiento poblacional y del riesgo de cuasi extinción en casos en que el método estándar sin error observación no lo hacía. Cuando había pocos datos para cualquiera de las variables de muestreo que probamos, la precisión decreció, y en algunos casos resultaron estimaciones sesgadas. Los resultados de nuestros AVP con las especies ejemplo fueron consistentes con información sobre estas especies en la literatura. Nuestro método puede facilitar AVP para un amplio rango de especies de interés para la conservación cuando se carece de datos demográficos pero se cuenta con datos de ocurrencia.},

In this study, three different enrichment items were added to outdoor enclosures of felids at the Montgomery Zoo to test their effects on activity levels and stereotypic pacing. Bones, frozen fish, and spices (cinnamon, chili powder, and cumin) were presented over a 3-month period to six species of felids: cheetah, cougar, jaguar, lion, ocelot, and tiger. Proportion of time spent engaging in active behaviors and stereotypic pacing were compared before, during, and after treatments. All treatments resulted in a significant increase in activity level from baseline (bones: +15.59\%; frozen fish: +35.7\%; spices: +12.38\%). Effects of enrichment items on activity levels were not sustained 7 days after removal. Proportion of time spent pacing significantly decreased during presentation of spices (-21.25\%) and frozen fish (-26.58\%), but not with the addition of bones. However, only the effect of frozen fish on stereotypic behavior was sustained 7 days after removal of the enrichment item. In conclusion, bones, spices, and frozen fish are inexpensive and easy-to-administer enrichment items that may be used to increase active behaviors of captive felids. Zoo Biol 26:371-381, 2007.

  abstract = {Personality is defined as inter-individual variation of behavioral traits while maintaining intra-individual stability. The focus of this study was to observe distinct personality trait categories, establish baseline personality trait phenotypes for the juvenile population, and compare the personality phenotypes between different categories, such as sex or generation. Three personality traits were studied—sociability, curiousity, and boldness—based on the percentage of time individuals spent with conspecifics, human researchers, and their mothers, respectively. The surveyed individuals significantly varied positively and negatively from the means of each trait, and no significant difference for any trait was found between males and females, or across time periods. A moderately strong correlation was discovered between two personality traits, boldness and curiousity, suggesting a personality syndrome. The second primary goal was to use the aforementioned baseline to determine if personality traits can be used to predict neophilic behavior specific to human-dolphin communication research. Six of the study subjects were more prone than their peers to engage with the two-way work, and these individuals were more bold—spent less time with their mothers—than the other subjects. This suggests that boldness has some predictive capabilities towards this type of neophilia.},

  abstract = {I present a general theory for the initial domestication of plants and animals that is based on niche construction theory and incorporates several behavioral ecological concepts, including central-place provisioning, resource catchment, resource ownership and defensibility, and traditional ecological knowledge. This theory provides an alternative to, and replacement for, current explanations, including diet breadth models of optimal foraging theory, that are based on an outmoded concept of asymmetrical adaptation and that attempt to explain domestication as an adaptive response to resource imbalance resulting from either environmental decline or human population growth. The small-scale human societies that first domesticated plants and animals share a number of basic interrelated attributes that when considered as an integrated and coherent set of behaviors provide the context for explaining initial domestication not as an adaptive response to an adverse environmental shift or to human population growth or packing but rather as the result of deliberate human enhancement of resource-rich environments in situations where evidence of resource imbalance is absent.},

  abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB), one of the oldest known human diseases. is still is one of the major causes of mortality, since two million people die each year from this malady. TB has many manifestations, affecting bone, the central nervous system, and many other organ systems, but it is primarily a pulmonary disease that is initiated by the deposition of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, contained in aerosol droplets, onto lung alveolar surfaces. From this point, the progression of the disease can have several outcomes, determined largely by the response of the host immune system. The efficacy of this response is affected by intrinsic factors such as the genetics of the immune system as well as extrinsic factors, e.g., insults to the immune system and the nutritional and physiological state of the host. In addition, the pathogen may play a role in disease progression since some M. tuberculosis strains are reportedly more virulent than others, as defined by increased transmissibility as well as being associated with higher morbidity and mortality in infected individuals. Despite the widespread use of an attenuated live vaccine and several antibiotics, there is more TB than ever before, requiring new vaccines and drugs and more specific and rapid diagnostics. Researchers are utilizing information obtained from the complete sequence of the M. tuberculosis genome and from new genetic and physiological methods to identify targets in M. tuberculosis that will aid in the development of these sorely needed antitubercular agents.},

  abstract = {KEYWORDS Attention, trigeminal pain, nociception, morphine, Oncorhynchus mykiss ABSTRACT This study aimed to assess fear responses to a novel object while experiencing a noxious event to determine whether nociception or fear will dominate attention in a fish in novel object testing paradigm. This experimentally tractable animal model was used to investigate (1) the degree of neophobia to a novel object while experiencing noxious stimulation, (2) the response of the fish after removing the fear-causing event by using a familiar object, and (3) the effects of removing the nociceptive response by morphine administration and examining the response to a novel object. Control animals displayed a classic fear response to the novel objects and spent most of their time moving away from this stimulus, as well as showing an increase in respiration rate when the novel object was presented. In contrast, noxiously stimulated animals spent most of their time in close proximity to the novel object and showed no additional increase in respiration rate to novel object presentation. There was evidence of a slight hypoalgesia in noxiously stimulated animals. The responses to familiar objects demonstrated that by familiarizing the animal with the object, fear was removed from the experiment. Both control and noxiously treated animals responded in similar ways to a novel object by spending the majority of their time in close proximity. Treatment with morphine reduced effects of noxious stimulation and appears to be an effective analgesic. After morphine administration, the acid-injected animals showed a neophobic response to a novel object and this was similar to the response of the control fish, with a similar amount of time spent moving away from the object and an increase in ventilation in response to the novel object. Morphine affected the fear response because both groups approached the novel object more quickly than the non-morphine controls. These results suggest that nociception captures the animal's attention with only a relatively small amount of attention directed at responding to the fear of the novel object. Many studies have examined the interplay of attentional mechanisms on pain thresholds and intensity and on pain-coping strategies. 74 Results from animal models have suggested that diverting attention},

To chart this process of behavioral confirmation, we observed successive interactions between one target and two perceivers. In the first interaction, targets who interacted with perceivers who anticipated hostile partners displayed greater behavioral hostility than targets whose perceivers expected nonhostile partners. Only when targets regarded their actions as reflections of personal dispositions did these behavioral differences in hostility persevere into their subsequent interactions with naive perceivers who had no prior knowledge about them. Theoretical implications of the behavioral confirmation construct for social perception processes are discussed.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the cognitive and behavioral consequences of our impressions of other people in the context of social stereotypes. Social stereotypes are a special case of interpersonal perception. Though they are usually simple and overgeneralized, many social stereotypes concern highly visible and distinctive personal characteristics, such as sex and race. These pieces of information are usually the first to be noticed in social interaction and can gain high priority for channeling subsequent information processing and interaction. As such, social stereotypes may be used to consider the cognitive and behavioral consequences of person perception. These stereotypes may influence information processing that serves to bolster and strengthen them. Stereotype-based beliefs may serve as grounds for predictions about the target's future behavior and may guide and influence the perceiver's interactions with the target. In this way, social stereotypes may create their own reality by channeling interaction in ways that cause the stereotyped individual to behaviorally confirm the perceiver's stereotype. The author describes an experiment designed to test this behavioral confirmation hypothesis. Because of the implications of the self-fulfilling effects of social stereotypes upon social interaction, the study of these stereotypes becomes important to social psychology. (Author/GC)},

The immediate clinical diagnosis of botulism and the key therapeutic decision in its management—administration of botulinum antitoxin—depend on a similar logic. That is, one has to know, or at least suspect, botulism at first sight to treat it properly. Laboratory confirmation by the mouse bioassay, the standard diagnostic test for decades, can take ⩾1 day to provide a definitive answer, is costly, and requires an animal facility [2]. Detectable toxin in the serum may be present transiently or at low levels [3]. The first diagnostic assay for botulism, developed during an outbreak investigation in 1896, was to feed the suspected food to experimental animals [4]. The current mouse assay, based on intraperitoneal injection of the mouse with serum or with fluid extracts of feces, foods, or culture broths, was standardized in the 1970s [5].},

  abstract = {© 2016 The International Society of Paddy and Water Environment Engineering and Springer JapanInorganic fertilisers need to be applied only when the inherent soil fertility alone cannot supply the plant nutrient demand for rice. When managing such systems, identification of the most sensitive morphological and/or physiological characteristics of a rice plant and the growth stage at which those responses appear when soil phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) availabilities have declined are important. Such a practice will increase fertiliser-use efficiency and enhance environmental sustenance. Experiment was conducted in a field differing in initial soil P and K availabilities due to the application of four fertiliser treatments for three consecutive seasons. Observations in this experiment were made in the fourth season. Four fertiliser treatments were the application of (i) both P and K (P1K1), (ii) only P (P1K0), (iii) only K (P0K1), and (iv) no P and K (P0K0). Rice variety Bg300 was grown. Shoot samples were obtained at two-week intervals, while root and soil samples were collected using a soil core up to 80 cm depth at physiological maturity. At physiological maturity, root length, diameter, and root length density were not responsive to the declined soil P and K availability, whereas the total above-ground dry weight (DW) reduced in P- and K-deficient plots. Shoot physiological responses [i.e. reduced green leaf P and K concentrations, and increased phosphorus-use efficiency (PUE) and potassium-use efficiency (KUE)] were more prominent than shoot morphological responses (i.e. plant height, number of tillers, and total above-ground DW), throughout the growth cycle. The intensity (i.e. statistical significance) and duration of the appearance of K deficiency symptoms were lower than those of P. The most sensitive growth stage of rice to slight deficiencies of P and K was the tillering stage. This knowledge on the morphological and physiological shoot and root responses that can be observed during the lifecycle of a rice plant, and the growth stage(s) at which those responses are prominent in response to declining soil P and K availability can be used when identifying the development of soil P and K limitations hindering the optimal growth of rice plant, and sustaining rice cropping systems.},

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to report the signalment, clinical signs, treatment options and outcome of dogs with DANP, and to propose a rationale for the clinical diagnosis. ANIMALS: Twenty-three dogs from four referral veterinary clinics from January 2002 to July 2018. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Retrospective analysis of medical records of dogs with diagnosis of DANP. RESULTS: The mean age at disease onset was 5.3~years. Nineteen dogs were pure-bred (11 different breeds) and four were mixed breed. Twenty-three dogs had a clinical diagnosis of DANP and three of these had histopathological confirmation. Eight dogs had episodes of profuse arterial bleeding from the lesion, nine had minor bleeding and six no bleeding. Twenty dogs were managed medically with monotherapy or combined therapy of topical tacrolimus, prednisolone, doxycycline and niacinamide, and/or pentoxifylline. Long-term tacrolimus was prescribed for 15 cases, eight of those cases as sole therapy. Treatment was declined for three dogs and four dogs were lost to follow-up. The lesion was satisfactorily controlled in 12 dogs and well-controlled in four dogs. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The distinctive presentation of DANP substantiates the clinical diagnosis. Medical treatment seems to be effective in controlling DANP and tacrolimus used as sole or adjunctive therapy appears to manage the disease satisfactorily.},

  abstract = {Epigenetics is increasingly regarded as a potential contributing factor to evolution. Building on apparently unrelated results, here I propose that RNA-containing nanovesicles, predominantly small regulatory RNAs, are released from somatic tissues in the bloodstream, cross the Weismann barrier, reach the epididymis, and are eventually taken up by spermatozoa; henceforth the information is delivered to oocytes at fertilization. In the model, a LINE-1-encoded reverse transcriptase activity, present in spermatozoa and early embryos, plays a key role in amplifying and propagating these RNAs as extrachromosomal structures. It may be conceived that, over generations, the cumulative effects of sperm-delivered RNAs would cross a critical threshold and overcome the buffering capacity of embryos. As a whole, the process can promote the generation of an information-containing platform that drives the reshaping of the embryonic epigenetic landscape with the potential to generate ontogenic changes and redirect the evolutionary trajectory. Over time, evolutionary significant, stably acquired variations could be generated through the process. The interplay between these elements defines the concept of “evolutionary field”, a self-consistent, comprehensive information-containing platform and a source of discontinuous evolutionary novelty.},

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of all patients presenting to our institution over the past 6 years with skull base CSF fistulas. RESULTS: Fifty-two patients were included in the study. beta2-Transferrin analysis of collected specimen was the most efficacious means of confirming a CSF leak. High-resolution computed tomography was the most informative radiographic study, yielding a sensitivity and an accuracy of 87\%. Magnetic resonance cisternography, yielding a sensitivity and an accuracy of 78\%, was instrumental in localizing the site of leak for a few cases but was most commonly corroborative. Using a graduated diagnostic approach, successful repair was attained in 88\% of cases after 1 attempt and 98\% after 1 or 2 attempts. CONCLUSION: For patients with skull base CSF fistulas, a graduated diagnostic approach with emphasis on confirmation of leak by beta2-transferrin analysis and precise localization by high-resolution computed tomography is both efficacious and cost effective.},

  abstract = {The Northern bald ibis ( Geronticus eremita ) (NBI) is one of the most threatened birds in the world. Intense conservation efforts have been undertaken and several research projects on the species are being done in Morocco and in Europe. Observing animal behaviour has been proved to be an efficient and non-invasive technique to assess the animal welfare, with the performance of a wide array of natural behaviours being one of the mostly used indicators of good mental and physical well-being. The aim of this study was to investigate the behaviour of a flock of 14 zoo-living NBI of different ages. The study focused on the variety of species-specific individual and social behaviours, in the light of reintroduction of the study juveniles in the wild. Per subject, 20 10-min. sessions were done. A continuous focal animal sampling method was used to collect individual and social behaviours. Behavioural data have been compared between adults and juveniles. Moreover, a Behavioural Variety Index (BVI) has been proposed and calculated based on previous literature describing natural ibis behaviours. The BVI might help in the evaluation of the variety of behaviours performed by each individual and the monitoring of the diversity of the behavioural repertoire of zoo animals. Our results showed that the birds performed species-specific behaviours and no abnormal behaviour was reported. Moreover, the BVI highlighted a good behavioural variety as each bird performed approximately 78\% of the natural behaviours described in the Northern bald ibis and in close relative species. Our findings seem to suggest the presence of qualitative and quantitative similarities between the behavioural repertoires of the study ibises and those described in wild conspecifics, suggesting a good welfare of the colony. Finally, the BVI proposed in the current study seems to be a useful and practical tool to test behavioural diversity in zoo animals.},

  abstract = {1. Animals group for various benefits, and may form either simple single-species groups, or more complex multi-species associations. Multi-species groups are thought to provide anti-predator and foraging benefits to participant individuals. 2. Despite detailed studies on multi-species animal groups, the importance of species in group initiation and maintenance is still rated qualitatively as 'nuclear' (maintaining groups) or 'attendant' (species following nuclear species) based on species-specific traits. This overly simplifies and limits understanding of inherently complex associations, and is biologically unrealistic, because species roles in multi-species groups are: (i) likely to be context-specific and not simply a fixed species property, and (ii) much more variable than this dichotomy indicates. 3. We propose a new view of species importance (measured as number of inter-species associations), along a continuum from 'most nuclear' to 'least nuclear'. Using mixed-species bird flocks from a tropical rainforest in India as an example, we derive inter-species association measures from randomizations on bird species abundance data (which takes into account species 'availability') and data on 86 mixed-species flocks from two different flock types. Our results show that the number and average strength of inter-species associations covary positively, and we argue that species with many, strong associations are the most nuclear. 4. From our data, group size and foraging method are ecological and behavioural traits of species that best explain nuclearity in mixed-species bird flocks. Parallels have been observed in multi-species fish shoals, in which group size and foraging method, as well as diet, have been shown to correlate with nuclearity. Further, the context in which multi-species groups occur, in conjunction with species-specific traits, influences the role played by a species in a multi-species group, and this highlights the importance of extrinsic factors in shaping species importance. 5. Our view of nuclearity provides predictive power in examining species roles in a variety of situations (e.g. predicting leadership in differently composed communities), and can be applied to examine a broad range of ecological and evolutionary questions pertinent to multi-species groups in general.},

Despite historic evidence that suggests the family Felidae share similar behavioral repertoires, no standardized ethogram providing comprehensive behavioral definitions exists. In order to create a working ethogram for the Felidae, we conducted a thorough literature review of published articles and books containing behavioral definitions designed for felid species. A total of 95 documents qualified for inclusion, and each was evaluated to identify the terminology used in its behavioral definitions, along with any categorization implemented. The articles included the behaviors of 30 species and 40 subspecies of felids, with the most frequent single study species being the domestic cat (Felis catus), followed by several "big cats". The results were organized into the following mutually exclusive groups for comparison: domestic cat studies, big cat studies, and small cat studies excluding domestic cats (i.e. small exotic cats). Systematic review of definitions confirmed that researchers tend to define felid behavior in similar manners, although some divergence was found between the inclusion of behaviors in domestic and exotic (non-domestic) cat studies. Information from the literature review was used to create a standardized, universal ethogram for use in future felid behavioral studies. The final ethogram suggests the use of "base behaviors" which can be altered using pre-defined modifiers in order to accommodate the requirements of individual studies while retaining consistent terminology. Common behavioral categories are also defined, and suggestions of behaviors that qualify within each category are presented to further assist researchers when developing their study. The ethogram was designed to be user-friendly with clear definitions for each behavior, which should be coherent to a diverse range of observers. We anticipate that use of this ethogram will save researchers time and effort in creating behavioral definitions for their study, while also assisting in unifying felid behavioral research.},

Systematic review of definitions confirmed that researchers tend to define felid behavior in similar manners, although some divergence was found between the inclusion of behaviors in domestic and exotic (non-domestic) cat studies. Information from the literature review was used to create a standardized, universal ethogram for use in future felid behavioral studies. The final ethogram suggests the use of "base behaviors" which can be altered using pre-defined modifiers in order to accommodate the requirements of individual studies while retaining consistent terminology. Common behavioral categories are also defined, and suggestions of behaviors that qualify within each category are presented to further assist researchers when developing their study. The ethogram was designed to be user-friendly with clear definitions for each behavior, which should be coherent to a diverse range of observers. We anticipate that use of this ethogram will save researchers time and effort in creating behavioral definitions for their study, while also assisting in unifying felid behavioral research.},

  abstract = {Standardized ethograms offer many practical benefits to behavioral researchers, and several examples exist today for various species and taxa. Despite historic evidence that suggests the family Felidae share similar behavioral repertoires, no standardized ethogram providing comprehensive behavioral definitions exists. In order to create a working ethogram for the Felidae, we conducted a thorough literature review of published articles and books containing behavioral definitions designed for felid species. A total of 95 documents qualified for inclusion, and each was evaluated to identify the terminology used in its behavioral definitions, along with any categorization implemented. The articles included the behaviors of 30 species and 40 subspecies of felids, with the most frequent single study species being the domestic cat (Felis catus), followed by several "big cats". The results were organized into the following mutually exclusive groups for comparison: domestic cat studies, big cat studies, and small cat studies excluding domestic cats (i.e. small exotic cats).

  abstract = {Identifying coping styles in cats may lead to improved health and welfare. The aims of this study were to (1) identify individual differences in response to acute confinement, and (2) to assess the predictability of guardian-rated personality traits on behavior. Adult cats (n = 55) were singly housed in enriched cages and behavioral observations were recorded for three days. On day 3, familiar and unfamiliar person approach tests were conducted. Fecal glucocorticoid metabolites (FGM) were quantified from voided samples. A questionnaire assessing personality traits and sickness behaviors was completed by each guardian. Analysis identified two clusters\&mdash;cats in Cluster 1 (n = 22) were described as shy, calm, mellow, and timid; cats in Cluster 2 (n = 33) were described as active, playful, curious, and easygoing. Multilevel mixed-effects GLM revealed significant differences between the clusters including food intake (C1 \&gt; C2, p \&lt; 0.0001), affiliative/maintenance behaviors (C2 \&gt; C1, p \&lt; 0.0001), vocalization (C2 \&gt; C1, p \&lt; 0.0001), hide (C1 \&gt; C2, p \&lt; 0.0001), perch (C2 \&gt; C1, p \&lt; 0.0001), and latency to approach a familiar (C1 \&gt; C2, p \&lt; 0.0001) and unfamiliar (C1 \&gt; C2, p = 0.013) person. No statistically significant differences in FGM concentrations were identified (cluster p = 0.28; day p = 0.16, interaction p = 0.26). Guardian-rated personality traits agreed with the response of the cats when confined to a cage, suggesting that domestic cats have different coping styles. Identifying individual differences in response to stressful events or environments may provide caretakers with important information leading to improved welfare.},

The male herded thefemale toanareaof1–2km2 , where we observed them throughout the observa- tion period. All behaviors were documented from when the adult female and her 2.5-yr-old cub were first observed being followed by an adult male, through separa- tion of the cub from its mother, a week of intense interactions preceding several days with copulation, after which they parted. They mated for 51, 86, 66, and 150 min on 9–10, 12, 13, and 14 May, respectively, and parted on 14–15 May. The male deterred three challengers. The peak breeding season for polar bears runs from early April through mid-May, although additional mating behavior has been documented in June. Timing of mating and duration of copulations in the wild were similar to reports from zoos. Induced ovulation, male intrasexual competition, female fitness, the mating system, and potential consequences of climate warming are discussed with insights made possible by documentation of the reproductive behavior of wild polar bears.

  abstract = {Intra-class correlations (ICC) and repeatabilities (R) are fundamental statistics for quantifying the reproducibility of measurements and for understanding the structure of biological variation. Linear mixed effects models offer a versatile framework for estimating ICC and R. However, while point estimation and significance testing by likelihood ratio tests is straightforward, the quantification of uncertainty is not as easily achieved. A further complication arises when the analysis is conducted on data with non-Gaussian distributions because the separation of the mean and the variance is less clear-cut for non-Gaussian than for Gaussian models. Nonetheless, there are solutions to approximate repeatability for the most widely used families of generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs). Here, we introduce the R package rptR for the estimation of ICC and R for Gaussian, binomial and Poisson-distributed data. Uncertainty in estimators is quantified by parametric bootstrapping and significance testing is implemented by likelihood ratio tests and through permutation of residuals. The package allows control for fixed effects and thus the estimation of adjusted repeatabilities (that remove fixed effect variance from the estimate) and enhanced agreement repeatabilities (that add fixed effect variance to the denominator). Furthermore, repeatability can be estimated from random-slope models. The package features convenient summary and plotting functions. Besides repeatabilities, the package also allows the quantification of coefficients of determination R2 as well as of raw variance components. We present an example analysis to demonstrate the core features and discuss some of the limitations of rptR.},

Normal development and preservation of life and species are dependent on a normally functioning stress system.

  abstract = {The influence of visitors on the welfare of captive animals, known as the visitor effect, may in some instances be stressful, adversely affecting animal health. Although the survival of many felid species depends on captive breeding programmes, little is known about this effect. A better understanding of the visitor effect is required to ensure the well-being of felids and the success of breeding programmes. We sought to determine whether the presence of visitors affects behaviour patterns and space use in five feline species in two Spanish zoos: Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx), jaguar (Panthera onca), bobcat (Lynx rufus), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) and Asiatic lion (Panthera leo persica) and, if so, whether the effect on animal welfare is positive or negative. To our knowledge, no previous research has addressed the visitor effect in these species, with the exception of the jaguar. Data on animal behaviour, enclosure use, and visitor density were collected during the spring and summer of 2011 and 2012. Changes were observed for all studied species when the zoo was open to the public: four species devoted less time to complex behaviour (ie play, walk) and spent more time resting; ocelots and bobcats made more use of hidden spaces and less use of areas closer to visitors, while the jaguar tended to do the opposite. No correlation was found between visitor density and animal activity, indicating that animals are affected by the mere presence of visitors, regardless of their number. Our findings are in line with those reported by other authors, who have suggested that these behavioural changes are linked to chronic stress. Visitor effect was classed as negative for the welfare of all studied species apart from the jaguar. We advocate the need for future research into potential solutions to mitigate the adverse effect of visitors on felids.}

In this study, college students responded, in person and online, to questions about their online activities and closest friends in three contexts: social networking sites, instant messaging, and face-to-face. Results showed that participants often used the Internet, especially social networking sites, to connect and reconnect with friends and family members. Hence, there was overlap between participants' online and offline networks. However, the overlap was imperfect; the pattern suggested that emerging adults may use different online contexts to strengthen different aspects of their offline connections.

  abstract = {The critically endangered Sumatran tiger (Panthera tigris sumatrae Pocock, 1929) is generally known as a forest-dependent animal. With large-scale conversion of forests into plantations, however, it is crucial for restoration efforts to understand to what extent tigers use modified habitats. We investigated tiger-habitat relationships at 2 spatial scales: occupancy across the landscape and habitat use within the home range. Across major landcover types in central Sumatra, we conducted systematic detection, non-detection sign surveys in 47, 17×17 km grid cells. Within each cell, we surveyed 40, 1-km transects and recorded tiger detections and habitat variables in 100 m segments totaling 1,857 km surveyed. We found that tigers strongly preferred forest and used plantations of acacia and oilpalm, far less than their availability. Tiger probability of occupancy covaried positively and strongly with altitude, positively with forest area, and negatively with distance-to-forest centroids. At the fine scale, probability of habitat use by tigers across landcover types covaried positively and strongly with understory cover and altitude, and negatively and strongly with human settlement. Within forest areas, tigers strongly preferred sites that are farther from water bodies, higher in altitude, farther from edge, and closer to centroid of large forest block; and strongly preferred sites with thicker understory cover, lower level of disturbance, higher altitude, and steeper slope. These results indicate that to thrive, tigers depend on the existence of large contiguous forest blocks, and that with adjustments in plantation management, tigers could use mosaics of plantations (as additional roaming zones), riparian forests (as corridors) and smaller forest patches (as stepping stones), potentially maintaining a metapopulation structure in fragmented landscapes. This study highlights the importance of a multi-spatial scale analysis and provides crucial information relevant to restoring tigers and other wildlife in forest and plantation landscapes through improvement in habitat extent, quality, and connectivity.},

  abstract = {The present study was performed to investigate the associations between eye-blink behaviors and various other factors in primates. We video-recorded 141 individuals across 71 primate species and analyzed the blink rate, blink duration, and "isolated" blink ratio (i.e., blinks without eye or head movement) in relation to activity rhythms, habitat types, group size, and body size factors. The results showed close relationships between three types of eye-blink measures and body size factors. All of these measures increased as a function of body weight. In addition, diurnal primates showed more blinks than nocturnal species even after controlling for body size factors. The most important findings were the relationships between eye-blink behaviors and social factors, e.g., group size. Among diurnal primates, only the blink rate was significantly correlated even after controlling for body size factors. The blink rate increased as the group size increased. Enlargement of the neocortex is strongly correlated with group size in primate species and considered strong evidence for the social brain hypothesis. Our results suggest that spontaneous eye-blinks have acquired a role in social communication, similar to grooming, to adapt to complex social living during primate evolution.},

  abstract = {Though air-breathing has probably evolved mainly as a response to hypoxia, it may provide an important oxygen supplement when metabolism is elevated, as for example during swimming. Due to the increased travelling distance involved when an air-breathing fish swims to and from the surface, and the increased drag when the surface is breached, it can be proposed that air-breathing results in a rise in the apparent cost of transport. In order to investigate this hypothesis, it is necessary to use a fish that is able to swim equally well with and without access to air. The striped catfish Pangasianodon hypophthalmus has been shown to have a sufficiently high capacity for aquatic oxygen uptake in normoxia, to allow for such a comparison. Here, we measured the partitioning of oxygen uptake (MO2) during swimming and recovery, and calculated the apparent cost of transport with and without access to air, under normoxic conditions. Aerial MO2 constituted 25-40 \% of the total MO2 during swimming and less than 15 \% during recovery. The net cost of transport was 25 \% lower in fish that did not air-breathe compared to fish that did, showing that the cost of surfacing can be substantial. This is the first study to measure partitioning in an air-breathing fish during swimming at velocities close to the critical swimming speed.},

Zoos worldwide maintain red pandas under a variety of housing environments and husbandry procedures that may affect the reproductive success and longevity of captive red pandas. The aims of the present study were to investigate how red pandas are kept in Japan and to obtain useful insights to increase their longevity by comparing the results from a questionnaire sent to Japanese zoos and those from a previous survey conducted in other countries. We received responses from 42 out of 52 zoos, holding a total of 219 individual red pandas, in Japan. The age-sex distribution indicated that red panda populations in Japan need close attention to be maintained sustainably. Of the husbandry aspects surveyed, the number of individuals in the same zoo, enclosure size, and the frequency of bamboo feeding factors indicated to affect reproductive success. Frequent monitoring of body weight, implementation of husbandry training, and bamboo feeding were also suggested as the reasons for the longevity of red pandas in Japan. Zoos were provided with sufficient physical features in on-exhibit enclosures, close monitoring for health status, and proper feeding, but other aspects of husbandry such as enclosure size and structures in off-exhibit spaces were insufficient and might compromise animal welfare.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION Poor oral hygiene is a major risk factor for oral diseases. Regular home-based care is essential to maintain good oral hygiene. In particular, mouthrinses can support conventional tooth brushing in reducing accumulation of oral plaque. Areas covered: The most common molecules contained in mouthrinses (chlorhexidine, essential oils, cetyl pyridinium chloride, triclosan, octeneidine, delmopinol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, hyaluronic acid, natural compounds) are discussed, together with relevant clinical and in vitro studies, focusing on their effects on periodontal health. Currently, chlorhexidine is the most efficacious compound, with both antiplaque and antibacterial activities. Similar results are reported for essential oils and cetyl pyridinium chloride, although with a somewhat reduced efficacy. Considering the adverse effects of chlorhexidine and its time-related characteristics, this molecule may best be indicated for acute/short-term use, while essential oils and cetyl pyridinium chloride may be appropriate for long-term, maintenance treatment. Expert opinion: The literature has not clearly demonstrated which compound is the best for mouthrinses that combine good efficacy and acceptable side effects. Research should focus on substances with progressive antibacterial activity, prompting a gradual change in the composition of oral biofilm and mouthrinses that combine two or more molecules acting synergistically in the mouth.},

Retrieving these memories is assumed to involve reactivation of neural ensembles that were established during learning. Although it has been possible to follow the activity of individual neurons shortly after learning, it has not been possible to examine their activity weeks later during retrieval. We addressed this issue by using a stable form of GFP (H2B-GFP) to permanently tag neurons that are active during contextual fear conditioning. Results: H2B-GFP expression in transgenic mice was increased by learning and could be regulated by doxycycline (DOX). Using this system, we found a large network of neurons in the hippocampus, amygdala, and neocortex that were active during context fear conditioning and subsequent memory retrieval 2 days later. Reactivation was contingent on memory retrieval and was not observed when animals were trained and tested in different environments. When memory was retrieved several weeks after learning, reactivation was altered in the hippocampus and amygdala but remained unchanged in the cortex. Conclusions: Retrieving a recently formed context fear memory reactivates neurons in the hippocampus, amygdala, and cortex. Several weeks after learning, the degree of reactivation is altered in hippocampal and amygdala networks but remains stable in the cortex. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Recent evidence suggests that preverbal infants' gaze following can be triggered only if an actor's head turn is preceded by the expression of communicative intent [1]. Such connectedness between ostensive and referential signals may be uniquely human, enabling infants to effectively respond to referential communication directed to them. In the light of increasing evidence of dogs' social communicative skills [2], an intriguing question is whether dogs' responsiveness to human directional gestures [3] is associated with the situational context in an infant-like manner. Borrowing a method used in infant studies [1], dogs watched video presentations of a human actor turning toward one of two objects, and their eye-gaze patterns were recorded with an eye tracker. Results show a higher tendency of gaze following in dogs when the human's head turning was preceded by the expression of communicative intent (direct gaze, addressing). This is the first evidence to show that (1) eye-tracking techniques can be used for studying dogs' social skills and (2) the exploitation of human gaze cues depends on the communicatively relevant pattern of ostensive and referential signals in dogs. Our findings give further support to the existence of a functionally infant-analog social competence in this species. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

This study examined the association between abstract reasoning and social functioning by assessing whether learning potential on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) relates to changes in social competence following social skills training (SST). Fifty-six veterans with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder completed a series of assessments followed by eight SST sessions. To evaluate learning potential, we assessed participants with the WCST and Category Test (CT), taught them a training protocol for the WCST, and retested on both measures. Participants learned the WCST, generalized this learning to improve their performance on the CT, and retained these gains for several weeks. Participants showed small improvements on the Maryland Assessment of Social Competence (MASC), but WCST learning potential and CT generalization were unrelated to improvement on the MASC.},

  abstract = {The rapid decline of the African lion (Panthera leo) has raised conservation concerns. In the Savé Valley Conservancy (SVC), in the Lowveld of Zimbabwe, lions were presumably reduced to approximately 5 to 10 individuals. After ten lions were reintroduced in 2005, the population has recovered to over 200 lions in 2016. Although the increase of lions in the SVC seems promising, a question remains whether the population is genetically viable, considering their small founding population. In this study, we document the genetic diversity in the SVC lion population using both mitochondrial and nuclear genetic markers, and compare our results to literature from other lion populations across Africa. We also tested whether genetic diversity is spatially structured between lion populations residing on several reserves in the Lowveld of Zimbabwe. A total of 42 lions were genotyped successfully for 11 microsatellite loci. We confirmed that the loss of allelic richness (probably resulting from genetic drift and small number of founders) has resulted in low genetic diversity and inbreeding. The SVC lion population was also found to be genetically differentiated from surrounding population, as a result of genetic drift and restricted natural dispersal due to anthropogenic barriers. From a conservation perspective, it is important to avoid further loss of genetic variability in the SVC lion population and maintain evolutionary potential required for future survival. Genetic restoration through the introduction of unrelated individuals is recommended, as this will increase genetic heterozygosity and improve survival and reproductive fitness in populations.},

On the basis of an interactionist principle of trait activation (R. P. Tett \& H. A. Guterman, 2000), a model is proposed that distinguishes among 5 situational features relevant to trait expression (job demands, distracters, constraints, releasers, and facilitators), operating at task, social, and organizational levels. Trait-expressive work behavior is distinguished from (valued) job performance in clarifying the conditions favoring personality use in selection efforts. The model frames linkages between situational taxonomies (e.g., J. L. Holland's [1985] RIASEC model) and the Big Five and promotes useful discussion of critical issues, including situational specificity, personality-oriented job analysis, team building, and work motivation.},

  abstract = {1.Distance sampling is a widely used technique for estimating the size or density of biological populations. Many distance sampling designs and most analyses use the software Distance.2.We briefly review distance sampling and its assumptions, outline the history, structure and capabilities of Distance, and provide hints on its use.3.Good survey design is a crucial prerequisite for obtaining reliable results. Distance has a survey design engine, with a built-in geographic information system, that allows properties of different proposed designs to be examined via simulation, and survey plans to be generated.4.A first step in analysis of distance sampling data is modelling the probability of detection. Distance contains three increasingly sophisticated analysis engines for this: conventional distance sampling, which models detection probability as a function of distance from the transect and assumes all objects at zero distance are detected; multiple-covariate distance sampling, which allows covariates in addition to distance; and mark-recapture distance sampling, which relaxes the assumption of certain detection at zero distance.5.All three engines allow estimation of density or abundance, stratified if required, with associated measures of precision calculated either analytically or via the bootstrap.6.Advanced analysis topics covered include the use of multipliers to allow analysis of indirect surveys (such as dung or nest surveys), the density surface modelling analysis engine for spatial and habitat modelling, and information about accessing the analysis engines directly from other software.7.Synthesis and applications. Distance sampling is a key method for producing abundance and density estimates in challenging field conditions. The theory underlying the methods continues to expand to cope with realistic estimation situations. In step with theoretical developments, state-of-the-art software that implements these methods is described that makes the methods accessible to practising ecologists.},

  abstract = {While power analysis is gaining popularity in many branches of biology (reviewed by Fairweather 1991; Taylor \& Gerodette 1993; Searcy-Bernal 1994), it has been largely ignored in others, including animal behaviour, despite attempts to draw it to general attention (Greenwood 1993). The purpose of this article is to reinforce Greenwood's advice by clearly demonstrating the relationship between sample size, biological significance and statistical power and by providing key references to introductory papers, texts and computer software. We use an example from Animal Behaviour to illustrate the importance of power analysis and the consequences of ignoring power. Our example is taken from a recent aquarium study on the willingness of juvenile rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss to forage under the risk of predation (Johnsson 1993). As a part of the study, the investigator tested the null hypothesis that large and small juvenile trout do not differ in their susceptibility to predation. To test this hypothesis, eight replicate groups of six large and six small juveniles were exposed one by one to a standardized encounter with a predatory adult trout. On average 19 plus or minus 4.9\% (X super(-) plus or minus SE) of the large fish and 45 plus or minus 7.0\% of the small fish were killed by the predator. The difference between the two size classes was not statistically significant using a Wilcoxon signed-ranks test and a significance criterion of alpha =0.05 (T super(+)=29, N=8, P=0.15). Does this mean that the null hypothesis of no difference should be accepted? Not necessarily: another possibility is that there exists a biologically significant difference in susceptibility to predation in the population, but that the test was not sensitive enough to detect it. Statistical power analysis allows the evaluation of these two alternatives},

  abstract = {Analysis of behaviour that is displayed in bouts depends crucially on quantitative estimates of bout criteria, that is, the lengths of the shortest intervals between bouts. Current methods estimate bout criteria by modelling the log-transformed (cumulative) frequency distributions of intervals between events. For analysis of feeding behaviour, these models will not result in biologically meaningful quantitative estimates (Tolkamp et al. 1998, Journal of Theoretical Biology194, 235-250). We proposed a method that models the frequency distribution of log-transformed interval lengths instead. Applying this method to a single data set showed that the log-transformed lengths of intervals between feeding events were distributed as two Gaussians. Here we test this model using a data set of 35 171 intervals between feeding that was obtained during an experiment with 38 cows in three dietary treatment groups. No meaningful bout criterion could be obtained for some individuals, which casts doubt on the general validity of the proposed model. Addition of a third log-normal improved the fit of the model and we hypothesized that this third population represents intervals including drinking. In a second experiment, we found the measurements to be consistent with this hypothesis. We obtained meaningful meal criteria for all individuals by fitting either a double, or a triple, log-normal model to the frequency distributions of the lengths of intervals between feeding. These log-normal models appear to be not only more biologically meaningful than log (cumulative) frequency models but also far more flexible.

  abstract = {Personality research has begun to take hold in the animal kingdom as psychologists turn to animal models to investigate various aspects of personality. Similarly, behavioral ecologists and related fields have begun to explore the idea that individual variation in behavior is more than just noise around an average for a given population or group of interest. As a result, many have begun to turn to personality-related questions to explain individual differences in animal behavior. Collectively, psychologists, ecologists and related fields have created a boom in animal personality-related research. This interest has expanded to a variety of fish species, with many studies focused on an important axis of behavior in humans: the shy-bold axis. Unfortunately, there has been very little consideration for the methodology employed. We review both the experimental and statistical methodology found in a body of research on fish species, for which personality-related research has been conducted. Our aim is to shed light on many important considerations that are often overlooked in order to facilitate research concerned with the reliability and validity of the many methods},

  abstract = {Traditionally, logic has been claimed to be 'the science of rational argument', but the relevance to our everyday disputes of the formal logician's results has remained unclear. The abstract character of traditional logic cuts the subject off from practical considerations; Mr Toulmin enquires why this is so, and shows how an alternative conception can be of more general value. Starting from an examination of the actual procedures in different fields of argument - the practice, as opposed to the theory, of logic - he discloses a richer variety than is allowed for by any available system. He argues that jurisprudence rather than mathematics should be the logician's model in analysing rational procedures, and that logic should be a comparative and not a purely formal study. These suggestions lead to conclusions which many will consider controversial; though they will also be widely recognized as interesting and illuminating. This book extends into general philosophy lines of enquiry already sketched by Mr Toulmin in his earlier books on ethics and the philosophy of science. The ordinary reader will find in it the same clarity and intelligibility; and the professional philosopher will acknowledge the same power to break new ground (and circumvent old difficulties) by posing fresh and stimulating questions.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the noninvasive monitoring of steroid hormone metabolites in feces of mammals and droppings of birds has become an increasingly popular technique. It offers several advantages and has been applied to a variety of species under various settings. However, using this technique to reliably assess an animal's adrenocortical activity is not that simple and straightforward to apply. Because clear differences regarding the metabolism and excretion of glucocorticoid metabolites (GCMs) exist, a careful validation for each species and sex investigated is obligatory. In this review, general analytical issues regarding sample storage, extraction procedures, and immunoassays are briefly discussed, but the main focus lies on experiments and recommendations addressing the validation of fecal GCM measurements in mammals and birds. The crucial importance of scrutinizing the physiological and biological validity of fecal GCM analyses in a given species is stressed. In particular, the relevance of the technique to detect biologically meaningful alterations in adrenocortical activity must be shown. Furthermore, significant effects of the animals' sex, the time of day, season, and different life history stages are discussed, bringing about the necessity to seriously consider possible sex differences as well as diurnal and seasonal variations. Thus, comprehensive information on the animals' biology and stress physiology should be carefully taken into account. Together with an extensive physiological and biological validation, this will ensure that the measurement of fecal GCMs can be used as a powerful tool to assess adrenocortical activity in diverse investigations on laboratory, companion, farm, zoo, and wild animals.},

What is unique in Vietnam is that although the Green Revolution ended in the mid-1980s in the Philippines and Indonesia, it has still been sustained as of 2003. Our analyses revealed that such growth had been supported by continuous improvements of modern varieties by regional research institutes. The varieties imported from China have contributed to the Green Revolution in northern Vietnam and those developed by the International Rice Research Institute in southern Vietnam. The national agricultural research systems have also played a critically important role in developing location-specific and appropriate technologies.},

  abstract = {Conducted a systematic analysis of space utilization in the home enclosures of 4 adult and 3 juvenile social groups of chimpanzees. The locations of all members of each group (excluding nursing infants) were recorded several times per week over a 3-mo period. Results indicate that adult chimpanzees were observed significantly more often in small vs large cages, on upper vs lower levels, and near cage perimeters vs cage centers. Analyses of sex differences in adults revealed that adult females were largely responsible for these space use patterns; adult males showed only a significantly higher usage of perimeter areas. Individual differences were found in the habitual use of certain enclosure sites. Juveniles showed no spatial patterns with regard to the above parameters but appeared to evenly use all available space. Both adults and juveniles were observed to be in contact with mesh barriers more often than with solid walls. Findings suggest that the incorporation of vertical structures, visual barriers, and multiple small areas to create complexity in captive chimpanzee housing is practical and may aid in creating an environment more conducive to normal social interaction.},

  abstract = {Security is an important and necessary part of any cultural institution's risk management program to adequately protect its assets. Every year millions of dollars are lost due to the theft of objects from museums, art galleries, libraries, archives, and places of worship. Some of these incidents are premeditated; others are simply "crimes of opportunity." Most could have been prevented had there been an effective security program with good controls in place. Another ongoing problem is wilful damage caused by vandalism and graffiti to artworks, historic sites, and buildings. This chapter will introduce security risk management based mainly on concepts developed by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and the Government of Canada Security Policy (GSP). While they may vary from those used in preservation, they are well established in the field of security and would be recognized by any security officer working in a museum. The first concept is Threat and Risk Assessment (TRA) that will help you determine new security measures required (RCMP 2000). For assessing risk, security measures in place must also be taken into account. These measures are commonly grouped around the concept of Protect, Detect, and Response (RCMP 2004). Protect includes the Avoid (Deter) and Block that are used in many other chapters in this book. An additional section on Recover has been added even though it is not generally included in the standard safeguard approach. Zoning is frequently used in security where a building is organized into different defensible spaces: from Public Zone to High Security Zone (RCMP 2005). Each zone will have different levels of Protect, Detect, and Response according to the vulnerability of the assets and the access required. For reasons of practicality, the Security Zone concept has been incorporated in the section Protect.},

  abstract = {Predation is considered one of the most important selective pressures on free-ranging animals. Our understanding of it derives mainly from studies of individual vigilance (visual scanning of the surroundings beyond the immediate vicinity) and aggregation in prey. Vigilance bears a direct relationship to aggregation, because animals in groups may rely on associates for early warning of danger. This review addresses the relationship between vigilance and aggregation with particular attention to the prediction that individual vigilance declines with increasing group size. Contrary to most other animals studied, primates do not support the prediction. Exploring this, I examined the assumptions underlying vigilance theory in the light of primate behaviour. First I tested whether manual harvesting and upright processing of food as seen among primates might permit them to feed and scan simultaneously. I found no support for this idea. Next I examined the targets of primate vigilance and found that one component (within-group vigilance) might explain the differences between primates and other animals. Finally, I evaluated whether individual primates in large groups face a lower risk of predation than those in small groups. A conclusion was impossible, but by separating group-level from individual-level risk, I was able to identify several common circumstances in which group size would not predict individual risk or vigilance. These circumstances arose for primates and nonprimates alike. I concluded that the relationship of vigilance to aggregation is not straightforward. The absence of a group-size effect on vigilance among primates is probably due to functional differences in vigilance behaviour or safety in groups, not to methodological differences. Furthermore, future work on animal vigilance and aggregation must fully consider both the targets of glances, and the assumption that larger groups are safer from predators. I predict that animals will not relax vigilance in larger groups if conspecific threat increases with group size. Group size will not predict individual risk of predation nor individual vigilance rates when predators do not rely on surprise, or when predators select a small subset of highly vulnerable group members.

  abstract = {Some conservationists argue for a focused effort to protect the most critically endangered species, and others suggest a large-scale endeavor to safeguard common species across large areas. Similar arguments are applicable to the distribution of scientific effort among species. Should conservation scientists focus research efforts on threatened species, common species, or do all species deserve equal attention? We assessed the scientific equity among 1909 mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians of southern Africa by relating the number of papers written about each species to their status on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List. Threatened large mammals and reptiles had more papers written about them than their nonthreatened counterparts, whereas threatened small mammals and amphibians received less attention than nonthreatened species. Threatened birds received an intermediate amount of attention in the scientific literature. Thus, threat status appears to drive scientific effort among some animal groups, whereas other factors (e.g., pest management and commercial interest) appear to dictate scientific investment in particular species of other groups. Furthermore, the scientific investment per species differed greatly between groups-the mean number of papers per threatened large mammal eclipsed that of threatened reptiles, birds, small mammals, and amphibians by 2.6-, 15-, 216-, and more than 500-fold, respectively. Thus, in the eyes of science, all species are not created equal. A few species commanded a great proportion of scientific attention, whereas for many species information that might inform conservation is virtually nonexistent.},

  abstract = {In South Africa, more than 30 small, enclosed game reserves have reintroduced lions over the last two decades, which now house more than 500 individuals. There is a high risk of inbreeding in these fragmented, fenced and isolated populations, which may be compounded by a lack of management guidelines. A population of 11 founder lions Panthera leo was reintroduced to Madikwe Game Reserve in 1995, and this population has in turn become a source for reestablishing other populations. Only four lineages were reintroduced, founder males were related to founder females, and since 1997, only one male lineage maintained tenure for {$>$}9 years, resulting in breeding with direct relatives. Interventionist management to limit lion population growth and inbreeding in Madikwe has taken the form of translocating, trophy hunting and culling of mainly sub adult lions. Despite this management, inbreeding started 5 years after reintroduction. Reproductive performance and thus population growth in Madikwe were dependent on the overall lion population density. When lion density was low, females first gave birth at a significantly younger age and produced larger litters, resulting in a high population growth rate, which decreased significantly when lion density in the park reached carrying capacity, that is, 61 lions. This might have profound consequences for future reestablishment of lion populations when restocking new reserves: our study illustrates the need for founder populations of reintroduced endangered predator species to be as large and genetically diverse as possible, and thereafter new genetic material should be supplemented. The development of such management guidelines is becoming very important as large predator populations become increasingly fragmented and managed as metapopulations. © 2010 The Authors.

However, ecology as a discipline and the diversity of those who call themselves ecologists have also been shaped and held back by often exclusionary Western approaches to knowing and doing ecology. To overcome these historical constraints and to make ecology inclusive of the diverse peoples inhabiting Earth’s varied ecosystems, ecologists must expand their knowledge, both in theory and practice, to incorporate varied perspectives, approaches and interpretations from, with and within the natural environment and across global systems. We outline five shifts that could help to transform academic ecological practice: decolonize your mind; know your histories; decolonize access; decolonize expertise; and practise ethical ecology in inclusive teams.

  abstract = {The lion (Panthera leo) is featuring ever more prominently on the agendas of international wildlife treaties like the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). Lion range and numbers have declined markedly over the last two decades. In this review we assess the present role of international wildlife treaties with a view to improving their combined contribution to the conservation and sustainable use of lions. Our analysis identifies a substantial body of relevant international wildlife law and, moreover, a significant potential for enhancing the contribution to lion conservation of these global and regional treaties. The time is right to invest in such improvements, and our review renders a range of general and treaty-specific recommendations for doing so, including making full use of the Ramsar Wetlands Convention, World Heritage Convention and transboundary conservation area (TFCA) treaties for lion conservation. The CMS holds particular potential in this regard and our analysis provides strong support for listing the lion in its Appendices.},

Transferability of this knowledge between species with similar ecological requirements is often assumed, but rarely tested. This is especially the case for glacial relict populations confined to climate-habitat traps from where they cannot move to rejoin areas with suitable environmental conditions. Using two glacial relict butterflies as model organisms, we first quantitatively define larval and adult resource-based habitat use of each species. Secondly, we test the transferability of ecological profiles (both habitat and ecological niche) between these two species that share both the same biotope and the same host plant. Our results show that both species have markedly different ecological requirements relating to differences in life history and behavioural traits (i.e. egg-laying strategies and mate-locating behaviour). Although the two species share many ecological features, they use different functional habitats within our study site. The high degree of interspecific niche overlap should indicate a high interspecific competition. However, we argue that their co-existence can be explained by the non-limiting abundance of some resources (e.g. host plants), by the partial separation in time of adult flight periods and by the territorial behaviour of one of the species. We discuss the following general messages: (1) functional habitat of a (threatened) species should be defined in a spatial context corresponding to individual station keeping, and (2) quick diagnosis based on similar ecological requirements may be misleading for the design of reliable conservation and restoration strategies. Detailed mechanistic and quantitative ecological understanding of resource-use and environmental tolerances across an organism's life cycle is essential for effective conservation in changing environments, like for glacial relict species.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To measure general practitioners' knowledge of, confidence with and attitudes to the diagnosis and management of dementia in primary care. SETTING: 20 general practices of varying size and prior research experience in Central Scotland, and 16 similarly varied practices in north London. Participants: 127 general practitioners who had volunteered to join a randomised controlled trial of educational interventions about dementia diagnosis and management. METHODS: Self-completion questionnaires covering knowledge, confidence and attitudes were retrieved from practitioners prior to the educational interventions. RESULTS: General practitioners' knowledge of dementia diagnosis and management is good, but poor awareness of its epidemiology leads to an over-estimate of caseload. Knowledge of local diagnostic and support services is less good, and one third of general practitioners expressed limited confidence in their diagnostic skills, whilst two-thirds lacked confidence in management of behaviour and other problems in dementia. The main difficulties identified by general practitioners were talking with patients about the diagnosis, responding to behaviour problems and coordinating support services. General practitioners perceived lack of time and lack of social services support as the major obstacles to good quality care more often than they identified their own unfamiliarity with current management or with local resources. Attitudes to the disclosure of the diagnosis, and to the potential for improving the quality of life of patients and carers varied, but a third of general practitioners believed that dementia care is within a specialist's domain, not that of general practice. More experienced and male general practitioners were more pessimistic about dementia care, as were general practitioners with lower knowledge about dementia. Those reporting greater difficulty with dementia diagnosis and management and those with lower knowledge scores were also less likely to express attitudes endorsing open communication with patient and carer. CONCLUSION: Educational support for general practitioners should concentrate on epidemiological knowledge, disclosure of the diagnosis and management of behaviour problems in dementia. The availability and profile of support services, particularly social care, need to be enhanced, if earlier diagnosis is to be pursued as a policy objective in primary care.},

  abstract = {Long term corrosion data for common alloy materials from test spool exposures in chlorinated fresh water are reported. Data from the published literature on the effect of chlorine in fresh water on materials are reviewed. Experience with the high initial dosages used to sterilize potable water systems is reported. As a biocide and an oxidant, chlorine has other and secondary effects on corrosion behavior. Case histories of several of these are reported. Guidelines for alloy usage are developed. CHLORINE! AS AN OXIDANT Chlorine is the primary oxidant, other than oxygen (aeration), used in treating cooling water, potable and waste water, and water used in swimming pools. Other oxidants used include potassium permanganate, ozone, chlorine dioxide and bromine. While these other oxidants have important uses, only the effect of chlorine on corrosion behavior is considered in this paper. Chlorine is added to potable water in several forms; as chlorine gas dissolved in chlorine water, as liquid sodium hypochlorite, the common household bleaching agent, and sometimes as calcium hypochlorite granules. In whatever form added, chlorine comes to equilibrium at pH 7.5 as hypochlorous acid and hypochlorite. HOC1 i---1 OCI- Below pH 7.5 hypchlorous acid, HOC], predominates; above pH 7.5, hypochloritc, OCT predominates. Chlorine is a very strong oxidizing agent for all metallic and organic species present. The reaction with iron follows: HOC] + 2Fe+ 5H,O --f 2Fe(OH),.l + Cl-+ 5H (2) Ferric hydroxide precipitates out and is normally deposited on the wall of the piping material. The pH is depressed and the chloride ion concentration is increased by the addition of chlorine. Chlorine also reacts with manganese and other metallic ions present, although to a lesser degree than with iron. Chlorine, in excess of the amount consumed in these reactions with metal ions, reacts with ammonia and organic matter forming chloramine, chloro-organic and other organic compounds. Chlorine, in excess of the demand from metallic and organic com- pounds present, is reported as free available chlorine (FAC), often less precisely as chlorine residual.? Of the common oxidizers, chlorine is the only one that has a residency time long enough to keep potable water disinfected from the treatment plant to point of use. However, chlorine reacts so readily with metallic and organic materials that the residual is consumed within a few days in most waters.},

  abstract = {In this paper the behavior of the Asiatic lion was studied during natural and gonadotropin-induced estrus in relation to fecal estradiol and progesterone concentration. The average length of estrus was 5.4 days and no significant difference was observed between natural and gonadotropin-induced estrus. Vocalization and rolling were the major estrus behavioral activities of Asiatic lions and the frequency of these activities were similar in both natural and gonadotropin-induced estrus and treatment with exogenous gonadotropin did not alter estrus behavioral activities. A significant positive correlation was observed between fecal estradiol and frequency of estrus behavior during natural and gonadotropin-induced estrus. Following gonadotropin treatment estrus could be induced in 69\% of animals and these induced animals ovulated following hCG treatment. This study reports for the first time the successful use of the non-invasive fecal steroid assay for monitoring the induction of estrus and ovulation in the Asiatic lion. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Background The aim of the study was to investigate the relative effectiveness of four strategies in detecting and preventing tuberculosis: contact tracing of smear-positive pulmonary disease, of smear-negative pulmonary disease and of non-pulmonary disease, and screening new entrants.  Methods An analysis of patient records and a TB database was carried out for an NHS Trust-based tuberculosis service in a socio-economically deprived area. Subjects were contacts of all patients treated for TB between 1997 and 1999. New entrants were screened in 1999. Outcomes measured were numbers of cases of active tuberculosis detected and numbers of those screened given chemoprophylaxis.  Results A total of 643 contacts of 227 cases of active TB were seen, and 322 new entrants to the United Kingdom. The highest proportion of contacts requiring full treatment or chemoprophylaxis were contacts of smear-positive index cases (33 out of 263 contacts; 12.5 per cent). Tracing contacts of those with smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis (12 out of 156; 7.7 per cent) and non-pulmonary disease (14 out of 277; 6.2 per cent) was significantly more effective in identifying individuals requiring intervention (full treatment or chemoprophylaxis) than routine screening of new entrants (10 out of 322; 3.1 per cent).  Conclusions Screening for TB of new entrants to the United Kingdom is part of the national programme for control and prevention of TB, whereas tracing contacts of those with smear-negative and non-pulmonary disease is not. This study demonstrates that, in our population, the contact-tracing strategy is more effective than new entrant screening. It is not likely that the contacts have caught their disease from the index case, but rather that in high-incidence areas such as ours such tracing selects extended families or communities at particularly high risk.},

The study aimed to provide answers to two questions - classification of factors invoking fear and aggression according to their significance and which of investigated dog breeds – German Shepherd, Rottweiler or Boxer is the most resistant to fear and aggression episodes? The exclusion of all factors on the cultivation of three breeds of dogs / they complied with the norms / found that the causes of fear aggressive conditions are listed as follows – first of fear and aggression depend on the temperament of the dog and on the second place of the breed origin, growing conditions and the associated level of primary and secondary socialization. Fear aggressive manifestations occur at least in dogs with sanguine and choleric temperament. Representatives of the breed "Boxer" and "German Shepherd" are at the same level on the manifestations of fear and aggression. Rottweiler breed is in third place in this direction.},

Here, we combined spatiotemporal fine-scale data from GPS radio collars on lions with habitat use information on 11 African herbivores in Hwange National Park (Zimbabwe) to test whether the risk of predation by lions influenced the distribution of herbivores in the landscape. Effects of long-term risk of predation (likelihood of lion presence calculated over four months) and short-term risk of predation (actual presence of lions in the vicinity in the preceding 24 hours) were contrasted. The long-term risk of predation by lions appeared to influence the distributions of all browsers across the landscape, but not of grazers. This result strongly suggests that browsers and grazers, which face different ecological constraints, are influenced at different spatial and temporal scales in the variation of the risk of predation by lions. The results also show that all herbivores tend to use more open habitats preferentially when lions are in their vicinity, probably an effective anti-predator behavior against such an ambush predator. Behaviorally induced effects of lions may therefore contribute significantly to structuring African herbivore communities, and hence possibly their effects on savanna ecosystems.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The breeding of lactating donkeys is increasing in Western Europe; with it the evaluation of body condition is growing in importance since it is considered a key principle for their welfare. However, assessment of body condition is a complex task, since several factors are involved. The aim of the present study is to investigate which animal-based indicators are the most reliable to describe the body condition of lactating donkeys. For this purpose, new animal-based indicators, which are easy to measure in field conditions (including body measurements, fatty neck score (FNS), dental score), are recorded and their relationship with BCS (a proxy measure for overall adiposity) was assessed. The ones that reveal an association with the BCS are included in an integrated principal component analysis to understand which are the most related to BCS., METHODS: Fifty-three healthy lactating donkeys of various breeds, including 7 Martina Franca, 10 Ragusano, 2 Romagnolo and 34 crossbreeds, were evaluated. The animal-based indicators that were recorded were: length (OP, olecranon tuber-pinbone and SH, shoulder-hip), heart girth (HG), abdominal circumference (AC), neck length (NL), neck height (NH) and neck thickness (NT) at 0.50 and neck circumference (NC) at 0.25, 0.50 and 0.75, body condition score (BCS) and fatty neck score (FNS). The owners' evaluation of the BCS was also considered. A dental assessment was performed and the month of lactation and age of each animal was recorded., RESULTS: No correlation was found between BCS and the other morphometric body measurements. On the contrary the FNS was correlated with the morphometric measurements of the neck (positive correlation to 0.50 NH and 0.50 NT, 0.50 NC, 0.75 mean NC, and negative correlation to the mean NC:NH and mean NC:NT, 0.50 NC:NT and 0.50 NC:NH ratios). A significant inverse relationship was identified between BCS and dental score. A Principal Component analysis (PCA) separated the BCS classes on the first principal component (PC1). PC1 revealed a meaningful positive correlation between the BCS and the neck measurements (NT, NH and FNS), with high positive loadings, while a negative correlation was found for dental abnormalities. The owners' evaluation of BCS was different from the expert evaluator' assessment, since they tended to give higher score that was slightly but significantly correlated to AC., DISCUSSION: A new scoring system, called Fatty Neck Score (FNS), has been proposed for the judgement of the adiposity status of donkey neck. The results suggest that caregivers might use the proposed animal based indicators (BCS, FNS and dental scores) together as a tool for the evaluation of the body condition of lactating donkeys. Our findings highlight that caregivers need to be trained in order to be able to properly record these indicators. Ultimately use of these indicators may help to improve the welfare of lactating donkeys.},

  abstract = {There is an increasing requirement for tools to assess and improve animal welfare in an objective and scientifically based manner. In our research a concept of welfare is applied which states that welfare is determined by the balance between positive and negative experiences. This concept implies that an interaction exists between stress systems and reward systems in the brain and, as a consequence: (I) negative experiences induce an increased sensitivity (ie need) for positive experiences; and (II) negative experiences can be compensated for by positive experiences. On this basis, two uses of reward-related behaviour can be hypothesised: (I) reward sensitivity may be used as a tool to assess the state of an animal in terms of welfare because it can indicate the current state of the balance that is dependent on previous (stressful) experiences; and (II) regular presentation of rewards may serve as a tool to counteract stress by shifting the balance to the positive side and, thus, to improve welfare. In order to investigate this, we used the rat as a model. Reward sensitivity was determined by the spontaneous behavioural response shown during expectation of a reward (ie anticipatory behaviour). A third (III) use of reward-related behaviour derives from the fact that anticipatory behaviour is influenced by the (rewarding) properties of the forthcoming reward (or other event) and, thus, may serve as a tool to assess the animal’s perception of this reward/event. This paper presents a descriptive overview of the evidence obtained thus far for the three proposed uses of reward-related behaviour. The biological background of our concept of welfare can be generalised to all (vertebrate) species, and anticipatory behaviour can be evoked in a wide range of other species. Therefore, this tool for measuring and improving the welfare of captive animals has great potential and will contribute to a good quality of life for captive animals.},

  abstract = {In recent years, it has been shown that humans have active brown adipose tissue (BAT) depots, raising the question of whether activation and recruitment of BAT can be a target to counterbalance the current obesity pandemic. Here, we show that a 10-day cold acclimation protocol in humans increases BAT activity in parallel with an increase in nonshivering thermogenesis (NST). No sex differences in BAT presence and activity were found either before or after cold acclimation. Respiration measurements in permeabilized fibers and isolated mitochondria revealed no significant contribution of skeletal muscle mitochondrial uncoupling to the increased NST. Based on cell-specific markers and on uncoupling protein-1 (characteristic of both BAT and beige/brite cells), this study did not show "browning" of abdominal subcutaneous white adipose tissue upon cold acclimation. The observed physiological acclimation is in line with the subjective changes in temperature sensation; upon cold acclimation, the subjects judged the environment warmer, felt more comfortable in the cold, and reported less shivering. The combined results suggest that a variable indoor environment with frequent cold exposures might be an acceptable and economic manner to increase energy expenditure and may contribute to counteracting the current obesity epidemic.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the in?uence on vehicle emissions and energy consumption of di?erent vehicle parameters and driving style as well as of tra?c measures taken in order to increase transport safety or to reduce tra?c jams. This should allow the Flemish Regional Government to perform more realistic modelling of the impact of transport on air pollution. The methodology is based on on-road measurements, roll-bench emission tests, vehicle simulations and regional emission modelling (for the Flemish Region, which encompasses the northern part of Belgium and is one of three entities that constitute the Federal Kingdom of Belgium). A vehicle simulation programme (VSP) has assisted in the assessment of the individual vehicle parameters (weight, gear shifts, tyre pressure, etc.). Di?erent drive styles (sportive, EcoDriving, etc.) were meas- ured on-road and evaluated on a roll-bench. Typical speed pro?les corresponding to di?erent tra?c measures such as roundabouts, phased tra?c lights, etc., were also recorded at di?erent locations in the Flemish Region. All data were distilled into small driving cycles, representative of a certain tra?c situation or driving style, and repeated on a roll-bench to measure the emissions in controlled circumstances. Technical solutions as well as educational programmes are proposed as possible measures to reduce the in?uence of driving style on emissions and fuel consumption. Finally, the results indicate how the emission calculations performed by the Flemish government can be improved.},

We found prevalence rates of bullying and victimization between 6 and 46\%, with teachers reporting significantly higher rates than peers. Furthermore, adolescents who scored high on teacher- and self-reported victimization were more likely to misinterpret non-bullying situations as bullying. The more often adolescents bullied, according to teachers and peers, and the less developed their ToM, the more they misinterpreted bullying situations as non-bullying. Implications for clinical practice are discussed.},

  abstract = {The electivity indices Ei and Ei′ of predator–prey interaction are currently used to quantify particle-size selection by grazers. Under conditions of passive, mechanical particle-size selection predicted by the leaky-sieve model, these indices yield electivity vs. particle-size curves that vary with the shape of the particle-size spectrum of food offered to the zooplankton. In addition to this bias, poor estimates of electivity will be obtained unless only a small fraction of the food is eaten in such experiments. The selectivity coefficient (Wi) used by modelers in feeding constructs and the electivity index Ei*, derived here, are recommended instead because they do not suffer from the shortcomings described for Ei and Ei′. Moreover, use of Wi′s and Ei*'s is recommended for quantifying selection for many other cases of predator–prey interaction. Key words: electivity indices, selectivity, selective grazing, predator–prey intraction, On utilise communément les indices d'électivité Ei et Ei′ de l'interaction prédateurs–proies quand il s'agit de quantifier le choix de la grosseur des particules par les brouteurs. Dans les conditions de la sélection mécanique passive de la grosseur des particules prédite par le modèle du tamis, ces indices donnent des courbes électivité vs grosseur des particules qui varient en fonction de la forme du spectre de grosseurs des particules offertes au zooplancton. En plus de ce biais, on obtiendra de pauvres estimations de l'électivité à moins qu'une petite fraction seulement de la nourriture soit mangée au cours de telles expériences. Au lieu de cela, on recommande le coefficient de sélectivité (Wi) utilisé dans la construction de modèles d'alimentation et l'indice d'électivité Ei*, tel que déduit ici, parce qu'ils n'ont pas les défauts qui ont été décrits pour Ei et Et′. On recommande en outre d'utiliser Wi et Ei* pour quantifier la sélection dans plusieurs cas d'interaction prédateurs–proies.},

  abstract = {During the past two decades, the paradigm for cancer treatment has evolved from relatively non-specific cytotoxic agents to selective, mechanism-based therapeutics. Cancer chemotherapies were initially identified through screens for compounds that killed rapidly dividing cells. These drugs remain a backbone of current treatment, but are limited by a narrow therapeutic index, significant toxicities, and frequently acquired resistance. More recently, an improved understanding of cancer pathogenesis has given rise to new treatment options, including targeted agents and cancer immunotherapy. Targeted approaches aim to inhibit molecular pathways that are critical to tumor growth and maintenance, whereas immunotherapy endeavors to stimulate a host response that effectuates long-lived tumor destruction. Targeted therapies and cytotoxic agents also modulate immune responses, which raises the possibility that these treatment strategies might be effectively combined with immunotherapy to improve clinical outcomes.

Zoledronic acid is a class III drug with poor oral bioavailability due to its poor permeability and low aqueous solubility; hence an attempt has been made to improve its solubility by co-crystallization technology. Pharmaceutical cocrystals are multi-component crystals with a stoichiometric ratio of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and cocrystal coformers (CCFs) that are assembled by noncovalent interactions such as hydrogen bonds, π-π packing, and Vander Waals forces. In this study the coformers selected were DL-tartaric acid and nicotinamide based on ease of hydrogen bond formation. The co-crystal of zoledronic acid with DL-tartaric acid were prepared in three ratios (1\,:\,1, 1\,:\,2 and 2\,:\,1) by slow solvent evaporation method and with nicotinamide in 1\,:\,1 ratio by dry grinding method. The formation of co-crystal was confirmed by powder X-ray diffractometry (PXRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Fourier transform (FT)IR. The dynamic solubility of co-crystals with DL-tartaric acid in the ratios 1\,:\,1, 1\,:\,2 and 2\,:\,1 increased by fold as compared to pure drug.},

They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn't hold with such nonsense. Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere. The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that. When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.},

  abstract = {Simple Summary The reduction in space available to wild animals in zoos and aquariums is widely perceived to be detrimental to their welfare by scientists and the general public alike. Evidence suggests that naturally wide-ranging carnivores are more likely to suffer in captivity than those that travel less widely. Using the Amur tiger as a representative for wide-ranging species frequently held in zoos, an expert panel assessment was undertaken to identify psychological priorities in order to see how the negative welfare impacts of reduced ranging opportunities might be most effectively overcome. This assessment highlights that whilst reduced access to space may be central to compromised welfare for many species, there may be more effective strategies in safeguarding welfare than simply making captive habitats marginally bigger. Central to this for Amur tigers is providing appropriate mental stimulation rather than focusing only on behaviours linked to hunting. Various strategies intended to safeguard welfare are discussed for Amur tigers, which can also be considered for other wide-ranging species. Abstract The ecology of large, wide-ranging carnivores appears to make them vulnerable to conservation challenges in the wild and welfare challenges in captivity. This poses an ethical dilemma for the zoo community and supports the case that there is a need to reconsider prevailing management paradigms for these species in captivity. Whilst the welfare challenges wide ranging carnivores face have been attributed to reduced ranging opportunities associated with the decreased size of captive habitats, attempts to augment wild carnivore welfare in captivity typically focus on behaviours linked to hunting. Thus far, this has yet to result in the systematic elimination of signs of compromised welfare amongst captive carnivores. Here an assessment is carried out to identify the likely welfare priorities for Amur tigers, which, as one of the widest ranging terrestrial carnivores, serves as an excellent exemplar for species experiencing extreme compression of their ranging opportunities in captivity. These priorities are then used to consider novel strategies to address the welfare challenges associated with existing management paradigms, and in particular, attempt to overcome the issue of restricted space. The insights generated here have wider implications for other species experiencing substantive habitat compression in captivity. It is proposed here that the impact of habitat compression on captive carnivore welfare may not be a consequence of the reduction in habitat size per se, but rather the reduction in cognitive opportunities that likely covary with size, and that this should inform strategies to augment welfare.},

  abstract = {It is commonly assumed that animals suffer if they cannot perform behaviours seen in wild conspecifics. Although comparisons with the behaviour of wild conspecifics are a popular method of assessing the welfare of captive animals, their validity has not been fully assessed. Homeostatic models of motivation suggest that many behaviours are stimulus driven rather than internally generated. Thus, it is possible that the non-performance of some wild-type behaviours does not necessarily compromise animal welfare, unless welfare is defined as being compromised by such non-performance. The flexibility of wild animal behaviour and the fact that animals free to perform the complete range of wild behaviours can suffer, must also put into the question the validity of such comparisons. Technical criticisms also arise when one considers the difficulty of constructing accurate and unbiased time budgets for wild animals. It is possible that the expressions of wild-type behaviours correlate with enhanced welfare, rather than cause enhanced welfare. Thus, if the consequences of behaviour are more important than the expression of behaviour itself environmental enrichment does not necessarily need to rely upon the performance of wild-type behaviours for the improvement of animal welfare. Therefore, although behavioural comparisons with wild animals can be considered as potentially useful indicators of behavioural differences, they cannot always be relied upon to give an objective assessment of animal welfare. To make an assessment of welfare, behavioural comparisons with wild animals should be used in conjunction with other techniques to demonstrate that the consequences of non-performance of wild behaviours results in impoverished welfare.},

Behavioural categories like active, passive, and abnormal behaviours were taken for the study. The activity budget was recorded as a single animal scan. The detailed baseline data of 150 hours, over a period of 30 days, were collected. At baseline, bears exhibited passive and more abnormal behaviours. Similarly, after application of the environmental tools like honey-log, underground food pipes, and wobbling box in the enclosure, the data were collected for 150 hours (30 days). Increased active behaviours and decreased abnormal behaviours were observed and showed highly significant changes in the abnormal behaviour as a whole when compared to the baseline level. During the postenrichment period, the data that were collected for 150 hours (30 days) showed no significant differences statistically between the behavioural categories. But certain level of difference was evident from the percentage of abnormal behaviours exhibited by individual bears. Among the enrichment devices, honey-log was the most preferred enrichment tool as revealed by the percentage of time spent by individual animal. The results show that application of enrichment tool continuously may bring long term effect in stereotypic behaviour.},

Animal welfare science can be considered as a new behavioural science, applied to societal concerns about our relations to animals, with specific research questions and methodologies inspired by other disciplines.

  abstract = {This study investigates determinants of sustainable food consumer behaviour in Belgium. To gain a better insight in sustainable consumption, a study was conducted in which attitudes and behaviour as well as the role of individual characteristics like confidence and values related to sustainable products are analyzed. The focus of the analysis is on exploring the influence of determinants as hypothesised by the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) - attitudes, perceived behavioural control, social norms - on sustainable consumption intention in general, and specifically depending on consumer's perceived confidence and personal values. The empirical research builds on a survey with a sample of 456 young adults using a questionnaire and showing an advertisement for hypothetical sustainable dairy products. Stepwise multiple regression models showed that 50\% of the variance in intention to consume sustainable dairy was explained by the combination of personal attitudes, perceived social influences, perceived consumer effectiveness and perceived availability. In addition, different levels of confidence and value orientation yield different strengths of the determinants. The findings yield public policy and marketing recommendations for stimulating sustainable food consumption among young adults. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {This article aims to summarize the present archaeo(zoo)logical knowledge and reflections on the origins of Neolithic animal domestication. It targets the main characteristics of early Neolithic animal domestication set against a backdrop of two complementary scales, namely the global and macro-regional scales (the latter using the example of the Near East). It discusses the conceptual and methodological issues, arguing in favor of an anthropozoological approach taking into account the intentions and the dynamics of human societies and critically analyzes the reductionist neo-Darwinian concepts of co-evolution and human niche construction. It also provides a brief discussion on the birth of ungulate domestication and its roots, as well as appropriate bibliographic references to enlighten the current status of domestication research. Résumé Cet article résume l’état présent des connaissances et des réflexions archéo(zoo)logiques concernant les débuts néolithiques de l’élevage des animaux. Il cherche à dégager les principales caractéristiques des premières domestications animales néolithiques en considérant ce phénomène à deux échelles complémentaires, mondiale et macro-régionale, la seconde étant illustrée par l’exemple du Proche-Orient. Il argumente en faveur d’une approche anthropozoologique de la domestication, prenant pleinement en compte l’intentionnalité et les dynamiques propres des sociétés humaines, et critique les concepts néo-darwiniens réductionnistes de coévolution et de construction de la niche humaine. En conclusion, il discute brièvement les raisons de la naissance de la domestication néolithique des ongulés. De nombreuses références bibliographiques sont données afin de préciser l’état des recherches sur la domestication des espèces.},

Sequences from both dogs and wolves showed considerable diversity and supported the hypothesis that wolves were the ancestors of dogs. Most dog sequences belonged to a divergent monophyletic clade sharing no sequences with wolves. The sequence divergence within this clade suggested that dogs originated more than 100,000 years before the present. Associations of dog haplotypes with other wolf lineages indicated episodes of admixture between wolves and dogs. Repeated genetic exchange between dog and wolf popu- lations may have been an important source of variation for artificial selection.},

It may lead to physical fatigue, stress, and frustration and can also jeop- ardize people’s safety.Designing wayfinding aids to fit people’s needs can facilitate their environmental knowledge acquisition and, therefore, improve their wayfinding performance. The scope of this article is human wayfinding in unfamiliar buildings, considering only individual pedestrian movement in an immersive virtual environment. The purpose is to investigate the use of external information at a higher level of awareness (e.g., signage) as a wayfinding aid, as well as the use of immersive virtual reality (VR) to study indoor wayfinding. Fifty-four volunteers accomplished a wayfinding task (i.e., finding a room from the building’s entrance) within a virtual building, employing two types of signage systems (i.e., vertical and horizontal conditions). A neutral condition (no signage) was also considered as a control condition to be used as a baseline. Aside from the success of the wayfinding task (getting to the destination), other performancemetrics (distance traveled, time spent, number of pauses, and average speed) were analyzed and compared. Although the differences found are not statistically significant, findings suggest that participants assigned to the horizontal condition traveled smaller distances, spent less time, made fewer pauses, and moved at higher average speed than those assigned to vertical and neutral conditions. Gender-related differences were found statistically significant only in the average speed variable (females were faster thanmales).},

The local reduction of elephant numbers for wildlife management objectives can involve contraception, killing excess animals, or translocation to alternative habitats. The effects these management decisions can have on the physiological stress response of free-ranging African savanna elephants are still not fully understood. We examined the effect of translocation on faecal glucocorticoid metabolite levels of an African elephant family group,which was translocated within the Kruger National Park, South Africa. We found that translocation resulted in a significant increase in faecal glucocorticoid metabolite levels (up to 646 ng/g wet weight) compared to (1) pre-translocation levels in this group, (2) post-translocation levels in this group, and (3) levels measured in undisturbed ‘control’ groups in the area. However, the faecal glucocorticoid metabolite levels had returned to {$<$}100 ng/g by the time the translocated animals had navigated their way back to their previous home range, covering 300 km in 23 days.},

Social intelligence is a facet of human intelligence that has been argued to be indispensable and perhaps the most impor-tant for success in life. This paper argues that next-generation computing needs to include the essence of social intelligence – the ability to recognize human social signals and social behaviours like turn taking, politeness, and disagreement – in order to become more effective and more efficient. Although each one of us under-stands the importance of social signals in everyday life situations, and in spite of recent advances in machine analysis of relevant behavioural cues like blinks, smiles, crossed arms, laughter, and similar, design and development of automated systems for Social Signal Processing (SSP) are rather difficult. This paper surveys the past efforts in solving these problems by a computer, it summarizes the relevant findings in social psychology, and it proposes a set of recommendations for enabling the development of the next generation of socially-aware computing.},

  abstract = {Ongoing rapid domestication of Atlantic salmon implies that individuals are subjected to evolutionarily novel stressors encountered under conditions of artificial rearing, requiring new levels and directions of flexibility in physiological and behavioural coping mechanisms. Phenotypic plasticity to environmental changes is particularly evident at early life stages. We investigated the performance of salmon, previously subjected to an unpredictable chronic stress (UCS) treatment at an early age (10 month old parr), over several months and life stages. The UCS fish showed overall higher specific growth rates compared with unstressed controls after smoltification, a particularly challenging life stage, and after seawater transfer. Furthermore, subjecting fish to acute stress at the end of the experiment, we found that UCS groups had an overall lower hypothalamic catecholaminergic and brain stem serotonergic response to stress compared with control groups. In addition, serotonergic activity was negatively correlated with final growth rates, which implies that serotonin responsive individuals have growth disadvantages. Altogether, our results may imply that a subdued monoaminergic response in stressful farming environments may be beneficial, because in such situations individuals may be able to reallocate energy from stress responses into other life processes, such as growth.},

In Study 1, we compared wolf and dog pups hand-reared individually and pet dogs of the same age in their readiness to form eye-contact with a human experimenter in an object-choice task and to follow her pointing gesture. The results showed that dogs already at 4 months of age use momentary distal pointing to find hidden food even without intensive early socialization. Wolf pups, on the contrary, do not attend to this subtle pointing. Accordingly in Studies 2 and 3, these wolves were tested longitudinally with this and four other (easier) human-given cues. This revealed that wolves socialized at a comparable level to dogs are able to use simple human-given cues spontaneously if the human's hand is close to the baited container (e.g. touching, proximal pointing). Study 4 showed that wolves can follow also momentary distal pointing similarly to dogs if they have received extensive formal training. Comparing the wolves to naïve pet dogs of the same age revealed that during several months of formal training wolves can reach the level of dogs in their success of following momentary distal pointing in parallel with improving their readiness to form eye-contact with a human experimenter. We assume that the high variability in the wolves' communicative behaviour might have provided a basis for selection during the course of domestication of the dog.},

Previous literature showed that Dutch middle-segment systems entail a relatively large gain in animal welfare at a relatively low increase in costs, i.e., have a high cost-efficiency. The question is to what extent these findings are applicable to other countries. Therefore, the aim of this study is to gain insight in the global prospects of middle-segment systems by exploring the cost-efficiency of these systems in other parts of the world. A set of representative countries, containing the Netherlands, United States and Brazil were selected. Cost-efficiency was defined as the ratio of the change in the level of animal welfare and the change in production costs. The level of animal welfare was measured by the Welfare Quality (WQ) index score. Data was collected from literature and consulting experts. Results show that in the Netherlands, United States and Brazil a change from conventional towards a middle-segment system improves animal welfare in a cost-efficient manner (the Netherlands 9.1, United States 24.2 and Brazil 12.1). Overall, it can be concluded that in general middle-segment production systems provide a considerable increase in animal welfare at a relatively small increase in production costs and therefore offer good prospects for a cost-efficient improvement of broiler welfare.},

  abstract = {No original abstract. This paper discusses how Piaget's work was extended to radical constructivism, and describes the basics of radical constructivist theory. Von Glasersfeld discusses several times a particular passage of Piaget's which he quotes, in which Piaget is speaking of the time between when a child is born and when he or she learns to speak: "he is for all practical purposes but one element or entity among others in a universe that he has gradually constructed himself, and which hereafter he will experience as external to himself" (p. 2). Von Glasersfeld says that most readers take this as a metaphor, but instead we should understand it literally. He contrasts Piaget's views with the 'realist' understanding of knowledge, saying "ever since Plato, the activity of knowing or cognizing has been viewed as a kind of copying or replicating" (p. 4), but insists that "Piaget approached the problem of cognition from an altogether different angle" (p. 5). From this he derives his own views, saying that his thinking is called radical constructivism because "It holds that the knower's perceptual (and conceptual) activity is not merely one of selecting or transforming cognitive structures by means of some interaction with existing structures, but rather a constitutive activity which, alone, is responsible for every type or kind of structure an organism comes to know" (p. 6). Again, "The constructivist remains aware of the experiencer's role as an originator of all structures" (p. 7). Remaining sections discuss 'the environment as a black box,' knowledge and equilibration', and a summary and conclusion.},

  abstract = {Sexual selection is potentially stronger than natural selection when the variance in male reproductive fitness exceeds all other components of fitness variance combined. However, measuring the variance in male reproductive fitness is difficult when nonmating males are absent, inconspicuous, or otherwise difficult to find. Omitting the nonmating males inflates estimates of average male reproductive success and diminishes the variance, leading to underestimates of the potential strength of sexual selection. We show that, in theory, the proportion of the total variance in male fitness owing to sexual selection is approximately equal to H, the mean harem size, as long as H is large and females are randomly distributed across mating males (i.e., Vharem=H). In this case, mean harem size not only provides an easy way to estimate the potential strength of sexual selection but also equals the opportunity for sexual selection, I(mates). In nature, however, females may be overdispersed with VharemH. We show that H+(k-1) is a good measure of the opportunity for sexual selection, where k is the ratio Vharem/H. A review of mating system data reveals that in nature the median ratio for Vharem/H is 1.04, but as H increases, females tend to become more aggregated across mating males with V(harem) two to three times larger than H.},

Like any emerging discipline, Data Science brings new perspectives and new tools to address new questions requiring new perspectives on traditionally established concepts. We explore a specific component of this discussion, namely the documentation and evaluation of Data Science-related research, teaching, and service contributions for faculty members seeking promotion and tenure within traditional departments of Statistics and Biostatistics.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis of low-dose triptolide and sorafenib alone or in combination on FLT3-ITD+ acute myeloid leukemia cell line MV4-11 and STAT5 pathway. METHODS: The MV4-11 cells were treated with low dose triptolide(IC20) and sorafenib(IC50) alone or in combination for 48 hours. The cell proliferation and inhibition were detected by using CCK-8 kit, the cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry, the expression of FLT3,STAT5 in mRNA and protein levels was detected by RT-PCR and Western blot respectively. RESULTS: The treatment of MV4-11 cells with low dose triptolide and sorafenib alone and in combination for 48 hours could inhibit cell proliferation and induce cell apoptosis, moreover the inhibitory rate and apoptotic rate of MV4-11 cells in drug-combination group both were higher than those in single drug group. The mRNA expression and protein expression of FLT3,STAT5 signaling pathway in drug combination group were significantly lower than those in single drug group. CONCLUSION: Low-dose triptolide combined with sorafenib can synergistically inhibit the proliferation and induce the apoptosis of MV4-11 cells, which may be related with the inhibition of FLT3 and STAT5 pathway.},

These concerns include the possible over-estimation of treatment effects in early stopped trials and a newer argument of a "freezing effect" that will halt future randomized clinical trials on the same comparison since an early stopped trial represents an effective declaration that randomization to the unfavored arm is unethical. The purpose of this study is to determine the degree of bias in designs that allow for early stopping and to assess the impact on estimation if indeed future experimentation is "frozen" by an early stopped trial. METHODS We perform simulations to study the effect of early stopping. We simulate a collection of trials and contrast the treatment-effect estimates (risk differences and ratios) with the simulation truth. Simulations consider various scenarios of between-study variation, including an empirically derived distribution of effects from the clinical literature. RESULTS Across the trials whose true effects are sampled from a uniform distribution, estimates from trials that stop early for efficacy deviate minimally from the simulation truth (median bias of the estimate of risk difference is 0.005). Over-estimation becomes appreciable only when the true effect is close to the null value 0 (median bias of the risk difference estimate is 0.04) or when stopping happens with 40\% information or less; however, stopping under these situations is rare. We also find slight reverse bias of the estimated treatment effect (median bias of the risk difference estimate is -0.002) among trials that do not cross the early stopping boundaries but continue to the final analysis. Similar results occur with relative risk estimates. In contrast, Bayesian estimation of the treatment effect shrinks the estimate from trials stopping early and pulls back under-estimation from completed trials, largely rectifying any over-estimation among trials that terminate early. Regarding the so-called freezing effect, the pooled effects from meta-analyses that include truncated randomized clinical trials show an unimportant deviation from the true value, even when no subsequent trials are conducted after a truncated randomized clinical trial. CONCLUSION Group sequential designs with stopping rules seek to minimize exposure of patients to a disfavored therapy and speed dissemination of results, and such designs do not lead to materially biased estimates. The likelihood and magnitude of a "freezing effect" is minimal. Superiority demonstrated in a randomized clinical trial stopping early and designed with appropriate statistical stopping rules is likely a valid inference, even if the estimate may be slightly inflated.},

  abstract = {Two unanaesthetized female yellow baboons (Papio cynocephalus cynocephalus) were infused (i.v.) with [3H]oestradiol and two with [3H]progesterone, early in the follicular phases of their cycles. One month later, the two females infused with [3H]oestradiol were simultaneously infused with [14C]progesterone and [3H]dehydroepiandrosterone. All urine and faeces were collected for 96 h after infusion. The proportion of steroid excreted in faeces (versus urine) was 10.0\% for oestradiol and 40\% for progesterone. Peak excretion in urine occurred 4.5 h after infusion. Peak excretion in faeces occurred an average of 36.4 h after infusion, with remarkable consistency between steroids. Eighty per cent of faecal oestradiol and progesterone metabolites were excreted as free (rather than conjugated) steroids. Simply boiling (20 min) the dried faecal sample in 90\% ethanol proved to be the most rapid and efficient means of extracting these steroid metabolites. High pressure liquid chromatography and immunoreactivity studies revealed that oestradiol was excreted in faeces as oestradiol (36\%), oestrone (44\%) and a conjugated metabolite that co-eluted with oestrone sulfate (20\%). Progesterone was excreted as eight different free forms, only a minor portion of which was progesterone, and what appeared to be a conjugated metabolite that co-eluted with pregnanediol-glucuronide (20\%). The free progesterone metabolites were identified by gas-chromatography-mass-spectrometry as epimers of 5-pregnane-3-diol and 5-pregnane-3-ol-one. These data suggest that currently available immunoassays for free oestradiol and oestrone should adequately characterize faecal oestrogen profiles in baboons. However, high variability in crossreactivities of various progesterone antisera to progesterone metabolites in baboons makes antiserum selection a more serious concern in attempts to quantify faecal progestogen dynamics.},

The lag times between iv injection of [3H] estradiol and [14C]progesterone and peak excretion of radioactivity in urine and feces were approximately 4 hr and 48 hr, respectively. The majority of progesterone metabolites recovered was excreted in feces (55\%) versus urine (45\%), whereas comparatively little of the recovered estradiol metabolites were excreted in feces (5\%) compared to urine (95\%). Intrasample variation in fecal hormone concentrations was extremely high but could be substantially reduced by extracting well-mixed fecal powder from freeze- dried samples, taken from the central or premixed portion of the wet sample. This method resulted in a close correspondence between matched serum and fecal progestins (mean correlation = 0.81, range 0.61-0.94) collected from five nonpregnant adult females over a 7-month period. Fecal estrogen profiles were more ambiguous, tending to overlap with those of fecal progestins. We conclude that analyses of fecal progestins can provide an effective, noninvasive means of characterizing ovarian activity in free-ranging African elephants.},

Trained domestic dogs were used to locate scat from caribou, moose, and wolves during winter surges in petroleum development. Evidence obtained from collected scat was then used to estimate resource selec- tion, measure physiological stress, and provide individual genetic identification for precise mark–recapture abun- dance estimates of caribou, moose, and wolves. Strong impacts of human activity were indicated by changes in resource selection and in stress and nutrition hormone levels as human-use measures were added to base resource selection models (including ecological variables, provincial highways, and pre-existing linear features with no human activity) for caribou. Wolf predation and resource selection so heavily targeted deer (Odocoileus virginiana or O hemionus) that wolves appeared drawn away from prime caribou habitat. None of the three examined species showed a significant population change over 4 years. However, caribou population estimates were more than double those of previous approximations for this area. Our findings suggest that modifying landscape-level human-use patterns may be more effective at managing this ecosystem than intentional removal of wolves.},

We compiled a dataset spanning 16 social learning studies (26 experimental conditions) carried out at the same study site over a 12-year period, incorporating a total of 167 chimpanzees. We applied a binary scoring system to code each participant's performance in each study according to whether they demonstrated evidence of using social information from conspecifics to solve the experimental task or not (Social Information Score-'SIS'). Bayesian binomial mixed effects models were then used to estimate the extent to which individual differences influenced SIS, together with any effects of sex, rearing history, age, prior involvement in research and task type on SIS. An estimate of repeatability found that approximately half of the variance in SIS was accounted for by individual identity, indicating that individual differences play a critical role in the social learning behaviour of chimpanzees. According to the model that best fit the data, females were, depending on their rearing history, 15-24\% more likely to use social information to solve experimental tasks than males. However, there was no strong evidence of an effect of age or research experience, and pedigree records indicated that SIS was not a strongly heritable trait. Our study offers a novel, transferable method for the study of individual differences in social learning.},

  abstract = {The concept that animals have personalities is gaining traction in the scientific community and is well established in zoos and aquariums. Applying knowledge of animal personalities has occurred more slowly and is most often only considered informally. However, animal personalities are likely to affect the welfare animals experience in captivity and thus should be of primary concern to zoo managers. In addition, animal personality likely affects the outcomes of zoo guest experiences and potentially guests' conservation-related behavior. With over 1,000,000 animals in the care of zoos internationally and hundreds of millions of visitors annually, it would be prudent and beneficial to maximize our use of animal personality data in zoos to effect positive conservation outcomes. Understanding how to broaden population planning techniques to include measures of animal personality and the important outcomes of welfare and education value is of prime importance to the zoo industry. In order to succeed, it is necessary to employ techniques that reliably assess animal personalities and provide measures that can easily be used in population planning models. We discuss the outcomes of recent workshops designed to determine the best techniques for measuring animal personalities in the zoo setting with the goal of incorporating personality into population planning.},

  abstract = {[BLURB] In The World Without Us, Alan Weisman offers an utterly original approach to questions of humanity's impact on the planet: he asks us to envision our Earth without us. In this far-reaching narrative, Weisman explains how our massive infrastructure would collapse and finally vanish without human presence; which everyday items may become immortalized as fossils; how copper pipes and wiring would be crushed into mere seams of reddish rock; why some of our earliest buildings might be the last architecture left; and how plastic, bronze sculpture, radio waves, and some man-made molecules may be our most lasting gifts to the universe. The World Without Us reveals how, just days after humans disappear, floods in New York's subways would start eroding the city's foundations, and how, as the world's cities crumble, asphalt jungles would give way to real ones. It describes the distinct ways that organic and chemically treated farms would revert to wild, how billions more birds would flourish, and how cockroaches in unheated cities would perish without us. Drawing on the expertise of engineers, atmospheric scientists, art conserva- tors, zoologists, oil refiners, marine biologists, astrophysicists, religious leaders from rabbis to the Dalai Lama, and paleontologists—who describe a prehuman world inhabited by megafauna like giant sloths that stood taller than mammoths—Weisman illustrates what the planet might be like today, if not for us. From places already devoid of humans (a last fragment of primeval European forest; the Korean DMZ; Chernobyl), Weisman reveals Earth's tremendous capacity for self-healing. As he shows which human devastations are indelible, and which examples of our highest art and culture would endure longest, Weisman's narrative ultimately drives toward a radical but persuasive solution that needn't depend on our demise. It is narrative nonfiction at its finest, and in posing an irresistible concept with both gravity and a highly readable touch, it looks deeply at our effects on the planet in a way that no other book has.},

  abstract = {Modern intensive farming conditions lack the diversity of substrates present in more natural environments and offer young animals fewer opportunities for interaction. Evidence exists that this may affect the organization of interactive patterns of behaviour, but shifts in behavioural diversity have not been measured directly. We investigated the effect of the substrate in the home pen on the diversity of behaviour in young growing pigs, Sus scrofa. Over 5 months, 26 pigs were housed singly in either substrate-impoverished (SI) or substrate-enriched (SE) conditions. Once every month we recorded the behaviour of these pigs in detail both in the home pens and in two novel object tests. In addition, we calculated the diversity of behaviour shown by SI and SE pigs in the home pen and in the novel object tests, using a relative behavioural diversity index. In the two novel object tests, SI pigs were less mobile than SE pigs and focused their behaviour on particular substrates. In addition, SI pigs showed less diverse behaviour than SE pigs. Our results show that the less diverse behaviour of SI pigs previously recorded in their home pens persists under novel conditions, supporting the hypothesis that substrate-impoverished housing conditions structurally affect the organization of behaviour in young growing pigs.},

Judgements of such quality are based on the integration of perceived details of how animals behave over time in different contexts. The scientific status of such judgements has long been ambiguous, but in recent decades has begun to be addressed by animal scientists. This paper starts with a brief review of qualitative approaches to the study of animal behaviour, which tend to address characteristics such as individuality, personality, and emotionality. The question then arises whether such characteristics involve a subjective, experiential aspect, and identify animals as sentient beings. The second half of this paper argues that taking the integrative nature of qualitative judgements seriously enables a 'whole animal' perspective, through which it becomes possible to view behaviour as a dynamic, expressive body language that provides a basis for assessing the quality of an animal's experience (eg contented, anxious). Judging this quality is a skill that requires knowledge of species-specific behaviour, experience in observing and interacting with animals in different contexts, and a willingness to communicate with animals as sentient beings. A substantial body of research indicates that this skill can function reliably in a scientific context, and can be applied usefully as a practical welfare assessment tool.

To establish a background for this analysis, I review existing models of prefrontal cortex function and present a synthesized model that includes a general function of temporal integration, supported by 4 specific processes: prospective memory, retrospective memory, interference control, and inhibition of prepotent responses. I found the frontal lobe hypothesis to perform well, with the exception of an inability to account for age-related declines in item recall and recognition memory, possibly a result of age-related declines in medial temporal function.},

  abstract = {With regards to the issue of animal training in the zoo community, there is some debate as to whether or not it should be considered a type of environmental enrichment (EE). This article suggests four criteria by which an intervention may be considered enrichment. The putative enrichment should (a) give the animal more control over its environment; (b) add behavioral choices; (c) promote species-appropriate repertoires; and (d) empower the animal to deal adequately with challenges. Using these criteria, I demonstrate that formal training using operant conditioning fulfills them all; some training may thus indeed be regarded as EE. Moreover, the application of a comprehensive training program will help animals obtain better welfare than can be achieved by conventional environmental enrichment (CEE) alone through the addition of other training techniques such as counter conditioning and systematic desensitization. A holistic behavior management plan should include CEE as well as a well-orchestrated and enriching training program; they complement one another and produce synergic welfare effects. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Social animals live and interact together, forming complex relationships and social structure. These relationships can have important fitness consequences, but most studies do not explicitly measure those relationships. An approach that explicitly measures relationships will further our understanding of social complexity and the consequences of both direct and indirect interactions. Social network analysis is the study of social groups as networks of nodes connected by social ties. This approach examines individuals and groups in the context of relationships between group members. Application of social network analysis to animal behaviour can advance the field by identifying and quantifying specific attributes of social relationships, many of which are not captured by more common measures of sociality, such as group size. Sophisticated methods for network construction and analysis exist in other fields, but until recently, have seen relatively little application to animal systems. We present a brief history of social network analysis, a description of basic concepts and previous applications to animal behaviour. We then highlight relevance and constraints of some network measures, including results from an original study of the effect of sampling on network parameter estimates, and we end with promising directions for research. By doing so, we provide a prospective overview of social network analysis' general utility for the study of animal social behaviour.},

  abstract = {MARK provides parameter estimates from marked animals when they are re-encountered at a later time as dead recoveries, or live recaptures or re-sightings. The time intervals between re-encounters do not have to be equal. More than one attribute group of animals can be modelled, The basic input to MARK is the encounter history for each animal. MARK can also estimate the size of closed populations. Parameters can be constrained to be the same across re-encounter occasions, or by age, or group, using the parameter index matrix. A set of common models for initial screening of data are provided. Time effects, group effects, time x group effects and a null model of none of the above, are provided for each parameter Besides the logit function to link the design matrix to the parameters of the model, other link functions include the log-log, complimentary log-log, sine, fog, and identity The estimates of model parameters are computed via numerical maximum likelihood techniques. The number of parameters that are estimable in the model are determined numerically and used to compute the quasi-likelihood Ale value for the model. Both the input data, and outputs for various models that the user has built, are staved in the Results database which contains a complete description of the model building process. It is viewed and manipulated in a Results Browser window. Summaries available from this window include viewing and printing model output, deviance residuals from the model, likelihood ratio and analysis of deviance between models, and adjustments for over dispersion. Models can also be retrieved and modified to create additional models. These capabilities are implemented in a Microsoft Windows 95 interface. The online help system has been developed to provide all necessary program documentation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The paper reports on the development of the WHOQOL-BREF, an abbreyiated version of the WHOQOL-100 quality of life assessment. METHOD: The WHOQOL-BREF was derived from data collected using the WHOQOL-100. It produces scores for four domains related to quality of life: physical health, psychological, social relationships and environment. It also includes one facet on overall quality of life and general health. RESULTS: Domain scores produced by the WHOQOL-BREF correlate highly (0.89 or above) with WHOQOL-100 domain scores (calculated on a four domain structure). WHOQOL-BREF domain scores demonstrated good discriminant validity, content validity, internal consistency and test-retest reliability. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that the WHOQOL-BREF provides a valid and reliable alternative to the assessment of domain profiles using the WHOQOL-100. It is envisaged that the WHOQOL-BREF will be most useful in studies that require a brief assessment of quality of life, for example, in large epidemiological studies and clinical trials where quality of life is of interest. In addition, the WHOQOL-BREF may be of use to health professionals in the assessment and evaluation of treatment efficacy.},

A questionnaire that existed as a Web page was devised, consisting of the IAT and 15 other questions regarding the respondents' demographic information and Internet usage. Participants were recruited through the Internet, yielding 86 valid responses (29 males and 57 females). Factor analysis of the IAT revealed six factors--salience, excessive use, neglecting work, anticipation, lack of control, and neglecting social life. These factors showed good internal consistency and concurrent validity, with salience being the most reliable. Younger and more recent users reported more problems, mainly concerning the neglect of work and social life. We expected interactive Internet functions to be more addictive; however, this was not found to be so. Overall, the IAT is a valid and reliable instrument that may be used in further research on Internet addiction.},

  abstract = {The number of broilers slaughtered globally is increasing. Ensuring acceptable welfare conditions for birds at the time of slaughter is paramount in meeting legislative and retailer specifications, and in producing high quality meat. There is knowledge that welfare training programs for members of the farming and red meat slaughter industry can improve animal welfare measures and product quality, however there is little evidence of the effects of welfare training in poultry processing plants. In our study, a comprehensive welfare training program was introduced to a Costa Rican and a British commercial broiler primary processing plant, both of which slaughter birds by way of neck cut post electrical water bath stunning. The effects of this program on some welfare and product quality measures were investigated, both immediately and six months post training. The welfare measures that showed significant improvements post training included; flapping at shackling, pre-stun shocks, stun parameters and effective neck cut. Product quality measures including broken wings and red pygostyles also improved, however the positive effect of training was not seen in all quality measures. Welfare training does have the potential to improve broiler welfare and product quality at slaughter, and these data could help the development and targeting of future welfare training courses and encourage the uptake of welfare training in the poultry slaughter industry.},

  abstract = {In North American zoos, hamadryas baboons (Papio hamadryas) have traditionally been housed as single one-male units (single male groups). In recent years, efforts have been made to house hamadryas in groups composed of multiple one-male units (multi-male groups) to more closely mirror their natural social structure, in addition to all-male or bachelor groups to manage surplus males. Given that the majority of social conflict in hamadryas occurs between males during the acquisition and defense of females, it was thought that managing hamadryas in these multi-male groups would result in increased rates of wounding. To assess this, incidences of wounding were recorded over one year across seven zoos (10 social groups, 59 individuals). Overall, we found no difference in wounding rates between group types, or by sex, and group type. These data provide evidence that managing hamadryas in multi-male and bachelor groups is an effective husbandry practice that does not negatively impact the welfare of the individuals, in addition to providing a more species-appropriate social setting for hamadryas in zoos. As the management of hamadryas in multi-male and bachelor groups continues and expands, additional research will be needed to understand what factors contribute to optimal cohesion, and welfare of groups and if wounding rates change as group size continues to increase.},

  abstract = {In order to be successful and have high standards of animal welfare, modern zoos strive to regularly modify, improve, and build animal enclosures and visitor areas. However, these periods of development could result in temporary durations of sub-optimal welfare for animals housed nearby. In this study, we monitored the behavior of three Asiatic lions (Panthera leo persica) prior to, during, and following a period of construction on a nearby building. Our results provide evidence that welfare may have been temporarily reduced during the construction period. Compared to the pre-construction period, the male exhibited an increase in pacing behavior and all three lions reduced the time they spent resting. We infer that the most significant negative stimulus related to the construction was sound and/or ground vibrations, as a physical barrier ruled out stress from visual stimuli. The behavioral response to the construction work was relatively short-lived and no long-term changes were observed one year on. This research highlights the importance of measuring animal behavior around events outside routine husbandry, and considering animal welfare on an individual basis. Finally, this work adds to the body of literature surrounding the impacts of construction on animal wellbeing and outlines some suggestions for potential mitigation.},

Untreated PKU is associated with an abnormal phenotype which includes growth failure, poor skin pigmentation, microcephaly, seizures, global developmental delay and severe intellectual impairment. However, since the introduction of newborn screening programs and with early dietary intervention, children born with PKU can now expect to lead relatively normal lives. A better understanding of the biochemistry, genetics and molecular basis of PKU, as well as the need for improved treatment options, has led to the development of new therapeutic strategies.},

  abstract = {Captive breeding for species of conservation concern is the act of bringing rare or endangered animals into captivity with the hope of rearing sustained captive populations for eventual reintroduction into the wild. Within captivity, genetic changes can occur that may reduce a species' ability to persist once a population is reintroduced back into its natural habitat. We sought to determine the efficacy of recommendations made to minimize genetic adaptation to captivity by addressing the following questions: (i) Are these recommendations already being carried out in captive programs? (ii) How practical is each recommendation? and (iii) Which recommendations call for future investigation? We performed an extensive search of the published literature for studies of non-domestic, non-model, captive animals in which the investigators used and reported a strategy that can minimize genetic adaptation to the captive environment. We found different forms of each recommendation already being executed in captive programs to varying degrees. In all, we reviewed 90 articles covering four broad categories of strategies. We conclude that the best approach to minimize genetic adaptation is to reduce the number of generations that a species spends in captivity. If this is not possible, then we suggest attempting to minimize generations first by delaying reproduction and then by cryopreservation of germplasm. Other strategies are effective to varying degrees depending on the species' natural history. A large gap in the current literature is the interactive effects of multiple strategies being implemented simultaneously, future research should focus on this issue. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Marginal costs, in this case, are the costs of increasing the number of founders or the population size by one animal. For a goal of retaining 90\% gene diversity for 10-15 generations (approximately 100 years), the current recommendation of 20 effective founders is very close to the least-cost solution when the ratio of the marginal costs is equal to one.

  abstract = {Abstract The merits of using the arcsine tra nsformation prio r to analyzing proportion data is being questioned in the published literature. While arcsine transformation stabilizes variance and normalizes proportional data, there are several reasons why this method can be problematic. An alternative analysis proposed to address the problems with normality of proportion data is the Generalized Linear Model logistic regression analysis. We compared the frequency of use of arcsine through time in ten leading biological journals. We tested the effectivene ss of both arcsine transformation and logistic regression in making the residuals meet the assumptions of normality, homogeneity and independence by noting changes in the residual plots and changes in the p - value and significance decision compared to the l inear regression on untransformed data using 40 data sets from the published literature. In the leading biological journals there is an obvious trend of an increased use of arcsine transformation on percentage data starting around the 1970s. Logistic regre ssion was able to improve the residuals’ normality, hom ogeneity and independence more often than arcsine. The arcsine transformation increased and decreased p values at almost the same rate. In comparison, logistic regression increased the p - value in 86\% o f the data sets, often resulting in a change in significance. The results suggest that logistic regression should be used as an alternative to the arcsine transformation in biological analysis.},

Risks of oral cancer were elevated by 40\% among male and 60\% among female mouthwash users, after adjusting for tobacco and alcohol consumption. Risks among both sexes generally increased in proportion to duration and frequency of mouthwash use. The increased risks were confined to users of mouthwash high in alcohol content, consistent with the elevated risks associated with drinking alcoholic beverages. Except for a higher prevalence of leukoplakia among cases, little relationship was found with oral or dental conditions, although denture wearing was reported more often by patients with cancer of the gums. These findings, together with other studies, provide further incentive for clarifying the association between mouthwash use and oral cancer.},

METHODS: Data are derived from the baseline investigation of the Early Developmental Stages of Psychopathology Study (EDSP), a prospective longitudinal community study of 3021 subjects, aged 14-24. Diagnoses were based on the DSM-IV algorithms of an expanded version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. RESULTS: Lifetime prevalence of DSM-IV/CIDI social phobia was 9.5\% in females and 4.9\% in males, with about one-third being classified as generalized social phobics. Twelve-month prevalence was only slightly lower, indicating considerable persistence. Respondents with generalized social phobia reported an earlier age of onset, higher symptom persistence, more co-morbidity, more severe impairments, higher treatment rates and indicated more frequently a parental history of mental disorders than respondents with non-generalized social phobia. CONCLUSIONS: History of DSM-IV social phobia was found to be quite prevalent in 14-24 year-olds. The generalized subtype of social phobia was found to have different correlates and to be considerably more persistent, impairing and co-morbid than non-generalized social phobia. Although generalized social phobics are more likely than non-generalized social phobics to receive mental health treatments, the treatment rate in this sample was low despite the fact that mental health services are free in Germany.},

  abstract = {Captive breeding has become an important tool in species conservation programmes. Current management strategies for ex situ populations are based on theoretical models, which have mainly been tested in model species or assessed using studbook data. During recent years an increasing number of molecular genetic studies have been published on captive populations of several endangered species. However, a comprehensive analysis of these studies is still outstanding. Here, we present a review of the published literature on ex situ conservation genetics with a focus on molecular studies. We analysed 188 publications which either presented empirical studies using molecular markers (105), studbook analyses (26), theoretical work (38), or tested the genetic effects of management strategies using model species (19). The results show that inbreeding can be minimized by a thorough management of captive populations. There seems to be a minimum number of founders (15) and a minimum size of a captive population (100) necessary in order to minimize a loss of genetic diversity. Optimally, the founders should be unrelated and new founders should be integrated into the captive population successively. We recommend that genetic analyses should generally precede and accompany ex situ conservation projects in order to avoid inbreeding and outbreeding depression. Furthermore, many of the published studies do not provide all the relevant parameters (founder size, captive population size, Ho, He, inbreeding coefficients). We, therefore, propose that a general standard for the presentation of genetic studies should be established, which would allow integration of the data into a global database. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Modern animal welfare assessments should aim to encompass positive affective states and the indicators that are useful in assessing these are discussed. When developing factors to be scored for each species, there is huge variability in the available information about the natural biology for some zoo species and even less information concerning those animals in captivity. Wild baselines are not always the most accurate indicator of what is right for an animal in captivity, which makes the identification of factors to include within species-specific welfare assessment even more challenging. When planning a welfare strategy for any species, it is important that the full range of their biological requirements and needs are considered, but this can be challenging for some zoo species and it is not possible to define a “one size fits all” welfare strategy. The different approaches for welfare assessment are reviewed, including the development of the Animal Welfare Assessment Grid which offers an evidence-based tool for continual welfare assessment, using technology where appropriate, to facilitate decision making and lead to improvements in the animals’ quality of life.},

  abstract = {The current extinction crisis is caused primarily by human impacts upon wild populations. Large carnivores are especially sensitive to human activity; because their requirements often conflict with those of local people, predators have been actively persecuted in most regions of the world. In this paper, the impact of people upon predators is analysed by relating local carnivore extinctions to past and projected human population densities. There are strong associations between high human density and the loss of carnivore populations from a region. Interspecific variation in ability to survive at high human densities probably reflects species' ability to adapt to human-modified habitats. However, regional and temporal variation in individual species' sensitivity to human density is more likely to reflect the activities of local people than the phenotypes of local carnivores. Local culture, government policy and international trade all influence human attitudes to predators and, therefore, the impact of people upon carnivore populations. The importance of these factors may mean that extinction risks for carnivores will continue to increase, even though human population growth is projected to deccelerate during the new millennium. This points to an urgent need for techniques to resolve conflicts between people and predators at either the local or landscape level.},

There are also different stages of development of the animal movement, and the different approaches adopted can influence the speed and progress of these. The study of this is vital to the understanding of the development of the movement, and our contribution to this development. This background note will concentrate on the early development of the movement, especially in the UK, which has the longest history for the protection of animals. However, many of its themes are paralleled in the history of the movements in other countries. We simply do not have the research to include a wide geographical area in this study (for which we apologise). We do, however, recommend that every animal protectionist fighting for social chance for animals researches the history of their own national movement. After studying animal protection history, we can learn that the movement cannot be isolated from social change, politics, culture and economics. In fact, the development of the animal protection movement is strongly connected to these wider environmental factors.},

Knowing where the ball and every player on the court are at all times throughout the course of the game produces almost endless possibilities, and it can be difficult figuring out where to begin. This article serves as a step-by-step guide for how to turn a data feed of one million rows of SportVU data from one NBA game into visualizable components you can use to model any player's movement. We detail some utility functions that are helpful for manipulating SportVU data before applying it to the task of visualizing player offensive movement. We conclude with visualizations of the resulting output for one NBA game, as well as what the results look like aggregated across an entire season for three NBA stars with very different offensive tendencies.},

  abstract = {The Scandinavian brown bear went through a major decline in population size approximately 100~years ago, due to intense hunting. After being protected, the population subsequently recovered and today numbers in the thousands. The genetic diversity in the contemporary population has been investigated in considerable detail, and it has been shown that the population consists of several subpopulations that display relatively high levels of genetic variation. However, previous studies have been unable to resolve the degree to which the demographic bottleneck impacted the contemporary genetic structure and diversity. In this study, we used mitochondrial and microsatellite DNA markers from pre- and postbottleneck Scandinavian brown bear samples to investigate the effect of the bottleneck. Simulation and multivariate analysis suggested the same genetic structure for the historical and modern samples, which are clustered into three subpopulations in southern, central and northern Scandinavia. However, the southern subpopulation appears to have gone through a marked change in allele frequencies. When comparing the mitochondrial DNA diversity in the whole population, we found a major decline in haplotype numbers across the bottleneck. However, the loss of autosomal genetic diversity was less pronounced, although a significant decline in allelic richness was observed in the southern subpopulation. Approximate Bayesian computations provided clear support for a decline in effective population size during the bottleneck, in both the southern and northern subpopulations. These results have implications for the future management of the Scandinavian brown bear because they indicate a recent loss in genetic diversity and also that the current genetic structure may have been caused by historical ecological processes rather than recent anthropogenic persecution.},

  abstract = {An introduction is given in this paper to the basic idea and the convergence theory of multilevel methods including overlapping domain decomposition methods and multigrid methods. Brief discussions are first given of some basic properties of some elementary linear iterative methods such as Jacobi and Gauss--Seidel iterations and preconditioned conjugate gradient methods, and then more detailed discussions are devoted to a general framework of subspace correction methods that can be applied to, among many other things, multilevel methods. A framework of auxiliary space methods is also briefly presented for the construction of preconditioners. The overlapping domain decomposition method and multigrid method are introduced with a model elliptic boundary value problem of second order. Convergence estimates are obtained for an overlapping domain decomposition method and especially for basic multigrid methods such as backslash (\textbackslash ) cycle, V-cycle and W-cycle. Two different approaches are used in the convergence analysis for multigrid methods. The first approach is the more traditional one that makes crucial use of elliptic regularity, while the second approach is based on the subspace correction framework that very weakly depends on the elliptic regularity. The first approach gives more precise estimates for simpler problems, while the second approach can be applied to more complex problems such as locally refined meshes and interface problems with large discontinuous jumps. As some more advanced topics, a general framework is briefly described on multigrid methods for nonnested multilevel subspaces and varying bilinear forms, and an optimal multigrid preconditioning technique is given for general unstructured grids using the auxiliary space framework. For nonsymmetric and/or indefinite problems, some two grid techniques are discussed. In addition to the aforementioned theoretical analysis, some discussions are also devoted to the implementation of some basic multigrid algorithms.},

The capture history of each animal is modeled as a Markov chain with a bivariate state space with states determined by the capture status (capture/noncapture) and marking status (marked/unmarked). In this framework, a conditional-likelihood method is used to estimate the population size and the transition probabilities. The classical behavioral model that assumes only an enduring behavioral effect is included as a special case of the bivariate Markovian model. Another special case that assumes only an ephemeral behavioral effect reduces to a univariate Markov chain based on capture/noncapture status. The model with the ephemeral behavioral effect is extended to incorporate time effects; in this model, in contrast to extensions of the classical behavioral model, all parameters are identifiable. A data set is analyzed to illustrate the use of the Markovian models in interpreting animals' behavioral response. Simulation results are reported to examine the performance of the estimators.},

A new therapy strategy combined chemo drugs and molecular-targeted drugs is considered to be promising for conquering these challenges. However, the different pharmacokinetic profiles, hydrophobicity and systemic toxicity of these drugs may still cause serious challenges to the clinical applications of this combination therapy. In this study, smart sorafenib (SF) and doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded nanodroplets (SF/DOX-NDs) were fabricated to solve the above issues. The liquid-to-gas phase transition of SF/DOX-NDs could function as a cavitation nucleus to boost drug release and increase cellular uptake after exposure to therapeutic ultrasound (TUS) irradiation. Additionally, this strategy has a therapeutic effect to induce apoptosis and inhibit the proliferation, migration, and invasion of hepatoma cells. Furthermore, the intense cavitation of SF/DOX-NDs at the tumor site could disrupt microvessels, which is beneficial for tissue-penetrating drug delivery inside tumors. Consequently, tumor angiogenesis was reduced, and tumor growth was remarkably inhibited by SF/DOX-NDs. These results indicated that combination therapy using SF/DOX-NDs may offer a promising approach to achieve effective HCC therapy with low side effects.},

  abstract = {Cooperation is the cornerstone of lion social behavior. In a notorious case, a coalition of two adult male lions from Tsavo, southern Kenya, cooperatively killed dozens of railway workers in 1898. The "man-eaters of Tsavo" have since become the subject of numerous popular accounts, including three Hollywood films. Yet the full extent of the lions' man-eating behavior is unknown; estimates range widely from 28 to 135 victims. Here we use stable isotope ratios to quantify increasing dietary specialization on novel prey during a time of food limitation. For one lion, the delta(13)C and delta(15)N values of bone collagen and hair keratin (which reflect dietary inputs over years and months, respectively) reveal isotopic changes that are consistent with a progressive dietary specialization on humans. These findings not only support the hypothesis that prey scarcity drives individual dietary specialization, but also demonstrate that sustained dietary individuality can exist within a cooperative framework. The intensity of human predation (up to 30\% reliance during the final months of 1898) is also associated with severe craniodental infirmities, which may have further promoted the inclusion of unconventional prey under perturbed environmental conditions.},

  abstract = {The aim of this paper is to review the gradually evolving body of the literature on Internet addiction. Two schools of thought have emerged: those authors who believe that Internet addiction merits classification as a new or emerging psychiatric disorder in its own right, and those who define certain individuals as having problematic Internet use in relation to specific online activities, such as gambling, email or pornography. Despite a total lack of methodologically sound research, the evidence appears to support the second perspective. It appears that individuals who are premorbidly vulnerable, especially with a history of impulse control and addictive disorders, are especially at risk of using the Internet in a problematic way. Aside from the personal and social implications of this finding, this behavior has important implications for the workplace and may be resulting in substantial loss of productivity in companies who are not implementing Internet governance policies. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

In southern Africa, reintroduction of lions (Panthera leo) to small reserves ({$<$}1000 km2) has increased in recent years but studies on their ranging behavior in these enclosed systems remain lacking. We applied Time Local Convex Hull (T-LoCoH) methods to study the home range establishment and utilization of 11 lions reintroduced to Dinokeng Game Reserve, South Africa, during 2011 through 2014. Lions established home ranges close to their release sites and during the following three years their home range sizes continued to increase, but in each individual case it remained smaller than half of the reserve area ({$<$} 70 km2). Space use strategies differed between core and entire home range, with higher frequency of visits found in core areas. Exceptionally high rates ({$>$} 60 separate visits) around the largest dam and along rivers suggest the importance of water and its surrounding vegetation in the lions' space utilization pattern. The home range size did not differ with season or sex of the individuals, whereas shifts in locations of home ranges revealed differences in the response of the two sexes to territorial conflicts and management interventions. Our study shows a dynamic home range utilization pattern and highlights the importance of both fine-scale space use patterns (frequency and duration of visits) and broad-scale home range changes in understanding the ranging behavior of reintroduced animals.},

The objective of this study was to enable the evaluation of SIRT1 expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from dogs by flow cytometry. Three transcript variants were amplified from PBMCs by reverse transcription PCR and the nucleotide sequences were analyzed. On the basis of deduced amino acid sequence, a monoclonal antibody against human SIRT1, 1F3, was selected to detect canine SIRT1. Canine SIRT1 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was successfully detected by western blotting using this antibody. Intracellular canine SIRT1 was also detected in permeabilized 293T cells transfected with a canine SIRT1 expression plasmid by flow cytometry using this antibody. SIRT1 was detected in all leukocyte subsets including lymphocytes, granulocytes and monocytes. The expression level was markedly different among individual dogs. These results indicated that the method applied in this study is useful for evaluating canine SIRT1 levels in PBMCs from dogs.},

The paper distinguishes between Bayesian inference, the use of Bayes Factors, and Bayesian data analysis using specialized tools. Given the importance of prior beliefs to these approaches, the review addresses those situations in which priors have a big effect on the outcome (Bayes Factors) versus a smaller effect (parameter estimation). Although there are many advantages to Bayesian data analysis from a philosophical perspective, in many cases a behavior analyst can be reasonably well-served by the adoption of traditional statistical tools as long as the focus is on parameter estimation and model comparison, not null hypothesis significance testing. A strong case for Bayesian analysis exists under specific conditions: When prior beliefs can help narrow parameter estimates (an especially important issue given the small sample sizes common in behavior analysis) and when an analysis cannot easily be conducted using traditional approaches (e.g., repeated measures censored regression).},

  abstract = {Even with global support for tiger (Panthera tigris) conservation their survival is threatened by poaching, habitat loss and isolation. Currently about 3,000 wild tigers persist in small fragmented populations within seven percent of their historic range. Identifying and securing habitat linkages that connect source populations for maintaining landscape-level gene flow is an important long-term conservation strategy for endangered carnivores. However, habitat corridors that link regional tiger populations are often lost to development projects due to lack of objective evidence on their importance. Here, we use individual based genetic analysis in combination with landscape permeability models to identify and prioritize movement corridors across seven tiger populations within the Central Indian Landscape. By using a panel of 11 microsatellites we identified 169 individual tigers from 587 scat and 17 tissue samples. We detected four genetic clusters within Central India with limited gene flow among three of them. Bayesian and likelihood analyses identified 17 tigers as having recent immigrant ancestry. Spatially explicit tiger occupancy obtained from extensive landscape-scale surveys across 76,913 km(2) of forest habitat was found to be only 21,290 km(2). After accounting for detection bias, the covariates that best explained tiger occupancy were large, remote, dense forest patches; large ungulate abundance, and low human footprint. We used tiger occupancy probability to parameterize habitat permeability for modeling habitat linkages using least-cost and circuit theory pathway analyses. Pairwise genetic differences (FST) between populations were better explained by modeled linkage costs (r{$>$}0.5, p{$<$}0.05) compared to Euclidean distances, which was in consonance with observed habitat fragmentation. The results of our study highlight that many corridors may still be functional as there is evidence of contemporary migration. Conservation efforts should provide legal status to corridors, use smart green infrastructure to mitigate development impacts, and restore habitats where connectivity has been lost.},

Plants include many substances that could be of a value in the whitening skin and working as anti-aging agents. A wide range of articles related to natural skin whitening and anti-aging agents have been reviewed. Many plant-derived and natural molecules have shown to affect melanin synthesis by different mechanisms, examples include Arbutin, Ramulus mori extract, Licorice extract, Glabridin, Liquiritin, Kojic acid, Methyl gentisate, Aloesin, Azelaic acid, Vitamin C, Thioctic acid, Soya bean extracts, Niacinamide, α and β-hydroxy acids, Lactic acid, Chamomile extract, and Ellagic acid. Some of the widely used natural anti-aging products as natural antioxidants, collagen, hyaluronic acid, and coenzyme Q can counteract the effects of reactive oxygen species in skin cells and have anti-aging properties on the skin. It was concluded that many natural products including antioxidants can prevent UV-induced skin damage and have whitening and anti-aging effects. It is very important to develop and stabilize appropriate methods for the evaluation of the whitening and anti-aging capacity of natural products and their exact mechanism of action to ensure real efficacy based on evidence-based studies. The attention should be oriented on the formulations and the development of an appropriate vehicle to ensure suitable absorption of these natural products in addition to evaluating the suitable concentration of these molecules required having the desired effects without causing harmful side effects.},

The aim was to find out the potential biomarkers and possible blood enriching mechanism of steamed notoginseng on hemolytic anemia rats. In the experiment,steamed notoginseng medicine pair( steamed notoginseng-ginseng)and compound medicines( Sanqi Yangxue Capsules) were used respectively to intervene in APH-induced hemolytic anemia model rats.Then blood routine indexes such as red blood cells( RBC),hemoglobin( Hb) and related organ indexes were determined. As compared with the blank group,the RBC and Hb levels in the model group were substantially decreased( P{$<$} 0. 01),while the liver and spleen organ indexes were increased( P{$<$} 0. 05). The results of blood routine and organ index demonstrated that the blood deficiency model was successfully established. Steamed notoginseng can significantly increase the RBC level of rats( P{$<$}0. 01),and the related indicators of each drug group had a trend of returning to normal levels,verifying the blood enriching effect of steamed notoginseng. The UPLC-Q-TOF-MS technique,principal component analysis( PCA) and partial least squares-discrimination analysis( PLS-DA) were used to analyze the metabolic profiles between the normal group and the model group. Twenty-six potential biomarkers for hemolytic anemia were screened in plasma. Nine metabolites such as retinol,L-valine,and arachidonic acid were down-regulated in the blood deficiency rats,and 17 metabolites such as protoporphyrin Ⅸ and niacinamide were up-regulated. The metabolic level of biomarkers could be changed to a normal state after rats were given with steamed notoginseng,drug pairs,and compound prescriptions. It can be speculated that steamed notoginseng may play a role of blood tonifying by improving biosynthesis of valine,leucine and isoleucine,as well as metabolic pathways such as retinol metabolism and arachidonic acid metabolism.},

Recent studies showed that particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) induced reactive oxygen species (ROS), causing disruption of DNA, lipids, and proteins; mitochondrial depolarization, and apoptosis of skin keratinocytes. Here, we investigated the protective effects of NIA on PM2.5-induced oxidative stress in human HaCaT keratinocytes. We found that NIA could inhibit the ROS generation induced by PM2.5, as well blocked the PM2.5-induced oxidation of molecules, such as lipids, proteins, and DNA. Furthermore, NIA alleviated PM2.5-induced accumulation of cellular Ca2+, which caused cell membrane depolarization and apoptosis, and reduced the number of apoptotic cells. Collectively, the findings show that NIA can protect keratinocytes from PM2.5-induced oxidative stress and cell damage.},

  abstract = {A promising strategy for drug abuse treatment is to accelerate the drug metabolism by administration of a drug-metabolizing enzyme. The question is how effectively an enzyme can actually prevent the drug from entering brain and producing physiological effects. In the present study, we have developed a pharmacokinetic model through a combined use of in vitro kinetic parameters and positron emission tomography data in human to examine the effects of a cocaine-metabolizing enzyme in plasma on the time course of cocaine in plasma and brain of human. Without an exogenous enzyme, cocaine half-lives in both brain and plasma are almost linearly dependent on the initial cocaine concentration in plasma. The threshold concentration of cocaine in brain required to produce physiological effects has been estimated to be 0.22±0.07 µM, and the threshold area under the cocaine concentration versus time curve (AUC) value in brain (denoted by AUC2(∞)) required to produce physiological effects has been estimated to be 7.9±2.7 µM·min. It has been demonstrated that administration of a cocaine hydrolase/esterase (CocH/CocE) can considerably decrease the cocaine half-lives in both brain and plasma, the peak cocaine concentration in brain, and the AUC2(∞). The estimated maximum cocaine plasma concentration which a given concentration of drug-metabolizing enzyme can effectively prevent from entering brain and producing physiological effects can be used to guide future preclinical/clinical studies on cocaine-metabolizing enzymes. Understanding of drug-metabolizing enzymes is key to the science of pharmacokinetics. The general insights into the effects of a drug-metabolizing enzyme on drug kinetics in human should be valuable also in future development of enzyme therapies for other drugs of abuse.},

We found that intravenous administrations of cocaine produced maximal maternal levels of benzoylecgonine below the plasma levels for cocaine. In contrast, oral administrations resulted in the maximal maternal plasma levels of this metabolite significantly above those of cocaine. The bioavailability of the orally administered cocaine was calculated as 25\%. Cocaine was detectable in the fetal plasma at maximal levels of approximately 1/5 of peak maternal levels for both single intravenous and single oral administrations. The maximal plasma levels of benzoylecgonine for the fetuses of the intravenously treated mothers were close to those of cocaine, whereas peak levels of this metabolite in the plasma of the fetuses of the mothers receiving the oral treatments were above those of cocaine. The chronic treatments resulted in significantly higher maximal levels of cocaine in the fetal circulation compared with those produced by single drug administrations.},

  abstract = {Background The effects of diet in cancer, in general, and breast cancer in particular, are not well understood. Insulin inhibition in ketogenic, high fat diets, modulate downstream signaling molecules and are postulated to have therapeutic benefits. Obesity and diabetes have been associated with higher incidence of breast cancer. Addition of anti-cancer drugs together with diet is also not well studied. Methods Two diets, one ketogenic, the other standard mouse chow, were tested in a spontaneous breast cancer model in 34 mice. Subgroups of 3–9 mice were assigned, in which the diet were implemented either with or without added rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor and potential anti-cancer drug. Results Blood glucose and insulin concentrations in mice ingesting the ketogenic diet (KD) were significantly lower, whereas beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) levels were significantly higher, respectively, than in mice on the standard diet (SD). Growth of primary breast tumors and lung metastases were inhibited, and lifespans were longer in the KD mice compared to mice on the SD (p{$<$}0.005). Rapamycin improved survival in both mouse diet groups, but when combined with the KD was more effective than when combined with the SD. Conclusions The study provides proof of principle that a ketogenic diet a) results in serum insulin reduction and ketosis in a spontaneous breast cancer mouse model; b) can serve as a therapeutic anti-cancer agent; and c) can enhance the effects of rapamycin, an anti-cancer drug, permitting dose reduction for comparable effect. Further, the ketogenic diet in this model produces superior cancer control than standard mouse chow whether with or without added rapamycin.},
